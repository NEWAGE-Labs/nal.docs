<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this operating system is to outline the procedures for the transportation,
receipt, handling, protection, storage, retention and/or disposal of test and/or calibration
items.
To outline the protocol that will be utilized in documenting the persons who have custody
of each sample from sample collection to disposal and the proper handling of data.
To outline the procedures and appropriate facilities for avoiding deterioration, loss, or
damage to the test or calibration item during storage, handling, preparation, and testing.
This operating system will provide guidance in Chain-of-Custody (COC) review and
decisions pertinent to the validity and acceptability of samples submitted for testing or
analysis.</p>
<h2 id="scope-field-of-application">Scope / Field of Application</h2>
<p>Efforts are made to minimize errors that can be introduced as a result of collecting and
handling the sample. The objective is to provide the laboratory with a set of samples that
closely represent the environment from which they were taken.
All samples received that are of unknown chemical content and background should be
received and handled within a properly operating and verified fume hood (minimum face
velocity of 100ft/min).</p>
<h2 id="definitions-and-acronyms">Definitions and Acronyms</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Chain of Custody (COC) – the unbroken paper trail or record of sample handling.</p>
<p>Holding time - time elapsed from the date of sampling until the start of testing.</p>
<p>Sample Delivery Group (SDG) – a unique ID given to samples received at the same
time for the same project.</p>
<p>Thermal Preservation – designed to help retain or maintain temperatures.</p>

Preservatives: Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), Nitric Acid (HNO3) and Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4)
Procedure
1. Fully executed Chain of Custody (COC) form(s) is filled out for every sample
delivery group received by NEW AGE.
2. The COC form(s) must be signed by the individual submitting the samples for
analyses.
3. The COC form(s) must be signed by all individuals relinguishing and accepting
possession of the samples from time of collection through transport, storage, and
delivery for analysis.
4. To ensure consistency and efficiency, sample handling (e.g., filtration,
decantation, centrifugation, sample splitting), preservation, storage, and
transportation procedures must be properly and accurately documented and
adhered to by field personnel.
5. Samples are received at the laboratory and a chain of custody form is initiated for
legal samples. NOTE - All samples received that are of unknown chemical
content and background should be received and handled within a properly
operating and verified fume hood (minimum face velocity of 100ft/min).
6. The sample receiving technician accepts samples and performs a series of checks
and inspections to assure all necessary sampling and preservation requirements
have been met, sample integrity has been maintained during transit, and that all
necessary information has been supplied.
7. In the event of damage to the sample, invalid containers, improper preservation,
or accedense of hold times the samples quality control deviation will be
documented on the chain of custody, deemed unacceptable, and the client
informed of the quality control deviation.
8. A Sample Delivery Group (SDG) is issued for the sample group.
9. Each sample submitted for analysis is given a unique lab sample ID identifiable to
the SDG to ensure traceability and confidentiality.
10. Upon successful completion of this system of checks, the SDG is logged into the
SDG tracking log, samples are handled and protected to avoid contamination, and
stored at temperatures and conditions appropriate for their preservation until time
for their preparation for analysis.
* If necessary the proper preservation of samples will be done
utilizing the appropriate reagent given the analysis requested by
the client.
* Preservatives are prepared from high-grade chemicals, and care is
taken to ensure that the sample is not contaminated by impurities
residing in the added preservative (if applicable).
* Samples are thermally preserved in coolers during transportation.
Refrigeration at 4 + 2°C is employed for the maintenance of the
quality of both preserved and unpreserved samples. NOTE: If
samples were collected within less than 4 hours upon receipt they
may not have reached 4 + 2ºC.
 If sample temperature between 4 + 2ºC is a condition of
acceptability then excess of this temperature criteria must be noted
on the COC and data from samples received in such condition
must be flagged in the final analytical report.
11. NOTE - When subcontracting samples for analyses, do the following: Samples
are tightly closed and packed to prevent spillage or breakage. Labels bearing the
sample identification, destination, and the word “FRAGILE” must be attached to
each container. The top of the carton is clearly identified as “THIS END UP”, and
the containers in a shipment are numbered (if applicable).
12. Laboratory personnel are notified of sample arrival, storage location, and holding
time concerns.
13. Samples are maintained in such a way to assure limited and authorized access
only.
14. Sample storage units are located in areas of the laboratory that are routinely
occupied by staff.
15. Samples that have been removed from storage for analysis are not left unattended.
16. Visitors to the laboratory are accompanied by laboratory staff at all time.
17. The facility is secured at the close of business each day.
Documentation
Each sample is uniquely identified and labeled upon receipt at the laboratory. Storage
records are maintained.
Complete records are kept of every transfer of data or samples to an individual,
laboratory, or storage facility. These records permit an investigator to determine who had
custody of the material and where it was at any given time. Custody documentation is
part of the support data and is available for review by an independent auditor.
Transfer documents are updated and maintained at a central location, such as the office of
the program or project manager. These records are of great importance in establishing the
validity of any questionable data.
Chain of custody assures that:
* only authorized personnel handle the sample
* only the field sampling techniques specified for the measurement program are used
Effective Date: 09/21/2017
* a record tag is attached to the sample immediately after collection and includes the
information such as:
* program or project identification
* sample field number
* location
* depth
* collection date
* time
* collector
* all records are completed
* the transfer of samples is documented
* transfer procedures provide for proper protection and preservation (e.g., if samples
are mailed, they should be sent by courier/certified mail with a request for an
acknowledgment of receipt)</p>
