<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>To control all quality management system documents (internally generated and from external
sources).
To identify changes/revisions made to documents.
To control amendments to documents by hand.
To control documents maintained in computerized systems.</p>
<p>Document control ensures that:
<em> authorized editions of appropriate documents are available at all locations where operations
essential to the effective functioning of the laboratory are performed
</em> documents are periodically reviewed and where necessary revised to ensure continuing
suitability and compliance with applicable requirements
<em> invalid or obsolete documents are promptly removed from all points of issue or use to assure
against unintended use
</em> obsolete documents retained for either legal or knowledge preservation purposes are suitably
marked</p>
<h2 id="scope-field-of-application">Scope / Field of Application</h2>
<p>This procedure applies to the Quality Manual, test methods, and standard operating procedures. Also
applies to externally generated quality management system documents.
Note – While there are standard formats for writing test methods and SOPs, documents may take on
different formats. These formats may consist of signs, flowcharts, pictures, drawings, sketches,
forms, and bulletized lists. Regardless of the format, all quality management system documents must
be controlled through this procedure.</p>
<h2 id="definitions-and-acronyms">Definitions and Acronyms</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Quality manual – document stating the quality policy, quality management system, and quality
practices of an organization.</p>
<p>Standard operating procedure (SOP) – a document that specifies or describes how an activity is to
be performed. It may include methods to be used and sequence of operations.
Responsibilities</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Laboratory management ensures that this document control procedure is established, implemented
and maintained. The Quality Manager oversees the day-to-day operations of document control. Laboratory
personnel are responsible for following this procedure in its entirety.
Materials Required</p>
<p>“Controlled Copy” colored ink stamp
“OBSOLETE” colored ink stamp
Master list
Procedure
The Quality Manager maintains a master list of all controlled documents.
Quality Manual:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Quality Manual is approved by the President and the signature of this approval is kept on file
by the Quality Manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Controlled hard copies are indicated by the “Controlled Copy” colored ink stamp at the bottom
of each page.
Procedures:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test methods and standard operating procedures are controlled documents with limited distribution.
They are kept in three-ring binders. The Table of Contents includes all current and obsolete
procedures assigned to a given work area and the following information:</p>
</li>
<li>the code and title of each procedure</li>
<li>the revision number of each procedure</li>
<li>the effective date of each procedure</li>
<li>review date – the date each procedure was last reviewed</li>
<li>
<p>the status of each procedure (current or obsolete)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unique codes are assigned for each procedure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test methods are written with the following headings:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scope</p>
</li>
<li>Description of Test Items</li>
<li>Holding Times</li>
<li>Quantities to be Tested</li>
<li>Materials and Equipment Required</li>
<li>Physical Environmental Conditions Required</li>
<li>Procedure</li>
<li>Sample Identification</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Safety Measures</li>
<li>Method for Data Analysis and Presentation</li>
<li>Sensitivity</li>
<li>Quality Control Plan</li>
<li>Reference Procedures</li>
<li>References</li>
<li>Revision History</li>
<li>
<p>Appendix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SOPs are written with the following headings:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purpose</p>
</li>
<li>Scope / Field of Application</li>
<li>Definitions and Acronyms</li>
<li>Responsibility</li>
<li>Materials Required</li>
<li>Procedure</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Reference Procedures</li>
<li>References</li>
<li>Revision History</li>
<li>
<p>Appendix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedures are peer-reviewed, authorized by management, copies uniquely identified, and distributed
to users. Signatures indicate the approval of the procedure and the “Controlled Copy”
colored ink stamp indicates document control is in effect for the procedure.
Note – The issue date (see header) is the date the document was issued to the user for review. The
effective date (see footer) is the date the document is effectively in place and followed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obsolete master copies are clearly marked obsolete and archived for at least six years. All other
draft copies and obsolete versions are destroyed to prevent inadvertent use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Quality Manager and their deputies maintain the master copies of the most current procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The master list of procedures includes:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>code</p>
</li>
<li>title</li>
<li>revision number</li>
<li>review date</li>
<li>status (current, obsolete, or assigned)</li>
<li>distribution list (copy number)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="document-review">Document Review:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Quality manual is reviewed annually by the Quality Manager. Records are kept of this review.</li>
<li>
<p>Written procedures are reviewed on a biennial basis. The reviewer makes a record of this review,
any required changes, and forwards to the Quality Manager.
Document Changes/Revisions:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes to the Quality Manual or a procedure require the same review and approval that performed
the original review and approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes are indicated by a vertical line in the left-hand margin adjacent to the revised area. The
master index is updated to reflect the changes in revision status and revision release date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personnel affected by the issue of a revised procedure are informed in writing. Revised procedures
are distributed for training purposes leading up to effective date. Holders of obsolete copies
return them to the Quality Manager and place the replacement into the manual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An index of obsolete quality manual sections and procedures is maintained.
Amendments by Hand:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where permitted, hand written amendments are clearly marked, initialed, and dated on all copies.
Computerized Documents:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Electronic copies of documents are maintained under the authority of the Quality Manager.</p>
</li>
<li>Access to electronic copies is password protected.</li>
<li>Documents that are revised are maintained in a folder identified as current; the obsolete version
is moved to a folder identified as obsolete.
Documentation
Revisions to Quality Manual sections and procedures are accompanied by a transmittal notice, which
details the appropriate additions, removals, and replacements.
