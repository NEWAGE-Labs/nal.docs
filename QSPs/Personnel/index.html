</blockquote>
<h2 id="responsibilities">Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Managers are responsible for assuring that the employees assigned to them are trained or otherwise
qualified for the assigned jobs. Before assigning an employee for the first time to a new job,
managers shall check their training to verify that the employee has been trained or qualified for the
new job.</p>
<p>Managers ensure that records of these assessments and subsequent training are maintained using the
Training Log sheets and stored as records, along with any supporting documentation (certificates,
diplomas etc.).</p>
<p>All Employees shall:
<em> bring to the attention of the manager their needs for specific or general training
</em> attend and participate in training sessions provided, whether in-house or external</p>
<p>Human Resources shall:
<em> ensure new hires possess qualifications, such as education, experience, and professional
credentials, which meet the requirements specified by job descriptions
</em> provide formal training for personnel and organizations as requested
* maintain the Registry of Skills</p>
<p>Supervisor shall:
<em> identify and document the required education, experience, and professional credentials for each
position that reports to them
</em> ensure that employees receive training in the quality management system
<em> identify continuing training requirements such as additional formal training, on-the-job training
(OJT), and certification
</em> develop training plans that address any gaps between current and required knowledge, skills, and
competencies needed to perform assigned tasks
<em> ensure training specified in the individual development plan section of the employee
performance appraisal is completed
</em> retain records of required training and completed training
<em> identify positions needing certification or special process qualification
</em> ensure only qualified personnel perform work affecting quality or ensure that tasks performed by
employees who have not yet received appropriate training are reviewed by an appropriately
qualified individual</p>
<h2 id="materials-required">Materials Required</h2>

<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
<p>The Manager/Supervisor uses the job description to identify and document education, experience,
and professional credentials of each position. The Supervisor shall prepare job descriptions when a
new position is established or duties of the position change.
The Training Review is an informal discussion between the manager and each employee in which
the employee’s job description, current skills/knowledge and current/future responsibilities are
compared in order to identify areas where additional training is necessary or beneficial.
Introductory Training
Upon date of hire, the manager introduces the new employee to a general set of training
requirements that must be completed prior to any further activities in the laboratory. This training
includes:
<em> an overview of the company’s history and its business philosophy
</em> a walk-through of the facility
<em> a review of the company’s personnel/orientation manual
</em> a review of the safety and chemical hygiene plan and a safety equipment walk-through/usage
review</p>
<h2 id="qaqc-training">QA/QC Training</h2>
<p>Prior to training in a specific laboratory, it is essential that the employee have a thorough
understanding of the general quality assurance/quality control principles and objectives that are the
underlying foundation of all work performed. Accordingly, a detailed review of the quality
management system is performed with the Quality Manager, as well as all QA/QC relevant to their
job (e.g., usage of logbooks, and proper protocols for accurate record keeping).
Laboratory Specific Training (Test Methods and SOPs)
Laboratory specific training includes:
<em> detailed training on the instrument(s) which the employee will use
</em> thorough coverage of the methods and SOPs to be employed
<em> laboratory specific technique training (e.g. sample aliquoting, sample introduction techniques,
standards preparation, use of syringes, pipettes, burettes, etc.)
</em> a complete review of all quality control plans, including data interpretation, calculating, and
reporting, for that lab area
The trainee:
<em> reads the test method / SOP
</em> Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) of required materials
<em> observes the trainer perform the procedure
</em> practices the procedure
<em> performs the procedure, under the direction of the trainer, using split samples, spiked samples or
proficiency samples
</em> performs the procedure, under direction of the trainer, using customer samples</p>
<h1 id="reads-and-then-reports-results-to-the-trainer">reads and then reports results to the trainer</h1>
<p>Unsatisfactory results require re-training. Revisions in SOPs require re-training of all affected
employees. The trainee is deemed competent by the trainer when they produce satisfactory results.
The trainer performs a follow-up evaluation to determine the effectiveness of training within one
month after training.
The department head is responsible for ensuring effective training. Upon completion of initial
training, all analysts are required to prove proficiency prior to analyzing customer samples.
Customer Complaints
Receptionists, managers, representatives, salespersons, and other employees likely to receive
complaints are trained in complaint handling procedures applicable to their functions. These
employees are trained in the relevant policies and procedures of the Quality Manual.
Change Control
All employees are to be advised that they perform their jobs as instructed or as covered by standard
operating procedures (SOP’s). They are NOT allowed to change tasks covered by SOP’s until the
change is approved according to the QSP - Document Control and Management.
Further procedures are defined on an ad hoc basis at the time training needs are identified for each
employee.
Performance Appraisal
The Supervisor shall use the employee performance appraisal to address the following:
<em> performance planning discussions with each employee
</em> employee’s knowledge of current quality management system procedures and work instructions
affecting the performance of their duties
<em> preparation of a performance plan to be signed by the employee
</em> a mid-term review of the current performance plan
* a year-end discussion with the employee and assessment of the year’s performance</p>
<p>The Supervisor shall identify positions that need certification and ensure that employees who hold
these positions have had the necessary training to become certified and remain certified.
The Supervisor shall ensure that formal, informal, or OJT training is provided to fill the gap(s)
identified in the performance appraisal.
At each scheduled employee performance review, the Supervisor shall assess the effectiveness of
training provided. Ineffective training will be addressed and a remedy will be identified and
implemented. A review will take place in the next performance appraisal.</p>
<p>Supervisors shall ensure that only qualified personnel perform work affecting quality or ensure that
tasks performed by employees who have not yet received appropriate training are reviewed by an
appropriately qualified individual.
Documentation
Comprehensive training of all laboratory staff is vital to the continued development of the staff as
well as the continued maintenance of the laboratory’s quality program. All staff training will be
conducted under the direction of the Technical Manager. All activities relative to training will be
thoroughly documented and maintained in each employee’s personnel training file. Included in this
file are copies of academic transcripts and/or degrees, resumes, job descriptions, all in-house
training records and all documents pertaining to external training (e.g. seminars, instrument
manufacturer training courses, etc.).
All classroom and on-the-job training are recorded on the training logsheet by the supervisor or
trainer for the employee. Records should include orientation, Quality Manual review, and
appropriate SOPs and test methods.</p>
