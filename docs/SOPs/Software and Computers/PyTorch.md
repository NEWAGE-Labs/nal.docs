## Related Procedures

[Python](./Python.md)  
[Pandas](./Pandas.md)  

## Purpose and Scope

The goal of this procedure is to provide understanding about the powerful computational tool: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

PyTorch is an application written in [Python](./Python.md) and built on top of [Pandas](./Pandas.md). It is designed for [Statistical](#statistic) and [Tensor](#tensor) calculations to facilitate [Machine Learning](#machine-learning) and [Deep Learning](#deep-learning).

## Terms and Definitions

#### Tensor

#### Statisic

#### Machine Learning

#### Deep Learning

## Training and Authorization

Both the [PyTorch Documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) as well as the "*PyTorch for Deep Learning*" Textbook can be used for training.

Authorization can be achieved by successfully completing a model, and documenting it using [Git](./Git.md)
