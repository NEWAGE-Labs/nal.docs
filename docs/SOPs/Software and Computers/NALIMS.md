## Purpose and Scope

The purpose and scope of this procedure is to give a functional overview of the **NALIMS** software implementation.

"NALIMS" is an acronym standing for **NEW AGE LABORATORIES' INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**, and is primarily used as described: *It is used as a system to manage information*.

Since NALIMS is a synecdoche of many other softwares, this procedure will primarily focus on how each of those other softwares fit together. Each individual software will then have a separate subsequent procedure further detailing its specific functionality, and also identifying the training/authorization requirements for achieving and documenting competency.

## Terms and Definitions

## Training and Authorization

Each individual software comprising NALIMS has a separate subsequent procedure further detailing its specific functionality and the training/authorization requirements for achieving and documenting competency.

Functionality *within* the NALIMS software is also segmented into separate [SOPs](../index.md) with their own training/authorization requirements for achieving and documenting competency.
