## Purpose and Scope

The goal of this procedure is to provide understand and guidance on performing, training on, and understanding the internal auditing process at NAL. Internal audits are one of the most powerful management system tools that we can utilize to help identify risks, discover opportunities for improvement, and verify conformity across the vast and complex structure of NAL. Internal audits are voluntary and are planned ahead of time according to the [NAL Internal Audit Program](#internal-audit-program).

## Terms and Definitions

###### Audit

>A systematic, independent and documented process for obtaining [objective evidence](#objective-evidence) and evaluating it objectively to determine the extent to which the [audit criteria](#audit-criteria) are fulfilled.  

> see: [QSP - Audits; Definition: 'Audit'](../../QSPs/Audits.md#audit)

###### Internal Audit

>An [audit](#audit) conducted by NAL on behalf of itself. Also known as a 'First Party Audit'.  

> see: [QSP - Audits; Defintion: 'Internal Audit'](../../QSPs/Audits.md#internal-audit)

###### Internal Audit Program

> The list of all planned internal audits for NAL.

## Internal Audit Program Details

The [NAL Internal Audit Program](#internal-audit-program) is an [audit program](../../QSPs/Audits.md#audit-program) hosted on the [NAL GitHub Organization Page](https://github.com/NEWAGE-Labs), and is implemented using a [GitHub Project](../Software and Computers/GitHub.md#project).


#### Internal Audit Program Requirements:

This program should include, at minimum, internal audit plans scheduled within the next 6 months and should include:  

- Objectives for the audit program;  
- [Risks](../../QSPs/Audits.md#risk) and opportunities associated with the audit program and the actions to address them;  
- Scope (extent, boundaries, locations) of each audit within the audit program;  
- Schedule (number/duration/frequency) of the audits;  
- [Audit Criteria](../../QSPs/Audits.md#audit-criteria) used to evaluate evidence against;  
- [Audit Methods](../../QSPs/Audits.md#audit-method) to be employed;  
- Criteria for selecting [audit team](../../QSPs/Audits.md#audit-team) members and [leader](../../QSPs/Audits.md#audit-team-leader);  
- Relevant documented information.  

#### Management of the Internal Audit Program

The [Quality Mangement Team](../../index.md#quality-management-team) is responsible for the maintenance of the [Internal Audit Program](#internal-audit-program). This includes implementing audits that are scheduled during their schedule time frames, and updating the audit plan based on [Management Reviews](../../QSPs/Management Review.md), in response to [Nonconformities](../../QSPs/Audits.md#nonconformity), and in accordance with new risks and opportunities identified.

#### Controlling Internal Audit Program Records

[Internal Audit Program](#internal-audit-program) records are stored and maintained in accordance with the [Quality System Manual](../../index.md) and [QSP - Technical Records](../../QSPs/Technical Records.md), and changes are preserved via [Git](../Software and Computers/Git.md) and controlled according to [QSP - Document Control and Management](../../QSPs/Document Control and Management.md).

Records are typically stored using branching, commits, pull requests, projects, issues, and merges on [GitHub](../Software and Computers/GitHub.md). The majority of records are stored within the [NAL Internal Audit Program GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/NEWAGE-Labs/projects/6) and inside [repositories](../Software and Computers/GitHub.md#repository) on the [NAL GitHub Organization Page](https://github.com/NEWAGE-Labs).

While [Issues](../Software and Computers/GitHub.md#issue) are not directly stored within [the Git tree](../Software and Computers/Git.md#the-git-tree), their number and reference is stored inside the commit message of the pull request. By locating the issue ID in the commit message, and pairing it with the issue ID for that respective repository, all records are able to be recreated outside of the [GitHub](https://github.com) web service.

#### Updating the Internal Audit Program

Updates to the [Internal Audit Program](#internal-audit-program) are made directly by the [Quality Mangement Team](../../index.md#quality-management-team), or someone else with [authorization to update the internal audit program](#training-and-authorization). Updates should be made promptly in response to [Nonconformities](../../QSPs/Audits.md#nonconformity), as a result of [Management Reviews](../../QSPs/Management Review.md), or based on newly identified [Risk](../../QSPs/Audits.md#risk) and opportunities for improvement.

#### Internal Audit Program Review

The [Internal Audit Program](#internal-audit-program) is reviewed by the [Quality Mangement Team](../../index.md#quality-management-team) and any other internal auditors to ensure the Internal Audit Program is being monitored and controlled to evolve with changing needs, methods, risks, opportunities, confidentiality, and objectives. This review is done periodically, and records are documented in accordance with [QSP - Technical Records](../../QSPs/Technical Records.md).
