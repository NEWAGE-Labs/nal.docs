## WELCOME!  

We would like to take this opportunity to welcome you to New Age/Landmark, Inc.

We are pleased to provide you with NAL’s Employee Handbook, which outlines the personnel policies and practices in effect at NAL. We are sure this employee handbook will be a helpful reference during your association with our company. We also encourage you to freely ask questions of management and co-workers whenever you might need clarification of the policies or procedures contained within this document. Please note that the Employee Handbook is not a contractual document.

Sincerely,

Scott D. Wall
President
 
## 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
The Employee Handbook has been prepared to introduce you to NAL. It will acquaint you with the policies, rules, pay, and benefits which apply to all employees at NAL
The information contained in this Employee Handbook is presented as a matter of information only and its contents are not, and should not be interpreted as, a contract for employment between NAL, and any of its employees.

Please read this Employee Handbook carefully and keep it handy for future reference. One of your first responsibilities as an employee of NAL is to be familiar with the contents of this handbook.

### 1.1 Policy Changes  
NAL expressly reserves the right to adopt new and/or amend, at any time, any of the policies referenced herein. Employees will be notified of these changes by a memorandum which will supersede conflicting provisions of this handbook. Changes will be effective on dates determined by NAL, and employees may not rely on policies that have been superseded. In addition, only the President of NAL has any authority to alter the foregoing.

If an employee is uncertain about any policy or procedure, he/she should check with a corporate officer for clarification.

### 1.2 Employment Relationship  
Employment with NAL is “at-will” as defined by Michigan law. An employee is free to resign at any time, for any reason, with or without notice. Similarly, NAL is free to conclude the employment relationship at any time. (See Section 2.0 EMPLOYMENT POLICIES - 2.13 Resignation, page 7).

This Page is intentionally left blank.
 
## 2.0 EMPLOYMENT POLICIES  

### 2.1 Definitions of Employment Status  
The following terms will be used to describe the classification of employees and their employment status:

Exempt - Employees whose positions meet specific tests established by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state laws, and who are exempt from overtime pay requirements.

Non-exempt - Employees whose positions do not meet FLSA and state exemption tests, and who are paid a multiple of their regular rate of pay for time worked in excess of forty (40) hours per week, in accordance with federal and state law.

Full-time - Employees regularly scheduled to work forty (40) hours or more per week.

Part-time - Employees regularly scheduled to work less than forty (40) hours per week.

Probationary - The first ninety (90) calendar days of a full-time or part-time employee’s employment with NAL

Regular - Employees who have completed the ninety (90) day orientation period.

Temporary - Employees who are hired for a pre-established period, usually during peak workloads or for personal leave relief. Temporary employees may work a full-time or part-time schedule; however, they are ineligible for NAL benefits.

Unless otherwise specified, a “year” means a calendar year.

### 2.2 Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action  
NAL maintains a policy of non-discrimination with employees and applicants for employment. No aspect of employment with us will be influenced in any manner by race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, physical or mental disability, height, weight, marital or veteran status, or any other basis prohibited by statute. These policies are the result of a continued effort on the part of management to assure compliance with all applicable affirmative action legislation.

Further, the company reasonably accommodates persons with mental or physical disabilities in accordance with applicable state and federal laws.

NAL supports employment practices that are closely monitored to assure that we are reaching out and assisting minorities and women to provide meaningful employment and opportunities for advancement. All personnel actions such as compensation, benefits, transfer, layoffs, returns from layoff, and the NAL-sponsored training and education programs are to be free of unlawful discrimination.

While all employees are responsible for developing and implementing existing programs that will advance Equal Employment Opportunity at NAL, it shall be the primary responsibility of NAL corporate officers to monitor such programs.

NAL expects all of its employees to conduct themselves with dignity and with respect for fellow employees and others. Harassment of others based on any protected category such as gender, age, race, etc., will not be tolerated. NAL does not condone or allow harassment of others, whether engaged in by managers, fellow employees, or by vendors (other non-employees who conduct business with NAL).

Any person who believes he or she has been subjected to harassment should report it immediately to a corporate officer of NAL. Each report will be given serious consideration and investigated thoroughly. Appropriate action, such as discipline up to and including termination, will be taken to eliminate such harassment from the work place. All reports of harassment and subsequent investigations will be handled discretely.

### 2.3 Probationary Period for New Employees  
The probationary period for new employees is ninety (90) calendar days from date of hire. During this time, the employee has the opportunity to evaluate NAL, as a place of employment, and NAL, has the opportunity to evaluate the employee. During the probationary period, both the employee and the company have the right to terminate employment without advance notice and without cause.

The probationary period involves the evaluation of performance. Upon satisfactory completion of the probationary period, the employee status will be changed to regular. All employees, regardless of classification, status, or length of service, are expected to meet and maintain NAL’s standards for job performance and behavior.

The benefits provided as described in this handbook are available to each full-time employee. Part-time or temporary employees are not eligible for these benefits. For each new full-time regular employee most benefits will begin on the ninety-first (91st) day following full-time status. For some benefits (i.e. simple IRA), there are other waiting periods for full-time, regular employees (refer to section 4.0). The accrual of personal leave hours begins on the first day of full-time employment.

### 2.4 Personnel Records  
Important events in each employee’s history with NAL will be recorded and kept in the employee’s personnel file. Performance reviews, change of status records, commendations, corrective action warnings, and educational attainment records are examples of records maintained.

Personnel files will be kept confidential to the extent consistent with the law. If an employee should want to review his/her file, he/she must contact a corporate officer to schedule an appointment.

All employees are responsible for notifying the company of changes in address, telephone number, and/or family status (births, marriage, death, divorce, legal separation, etc.), as income tax status and group insurance may be affected by these changes. This responsibility includes employees on layoff status and leaves of absence. Employees should also advise the company of any degrees or registrations obtained and of membership in any professional or technical organizations.

### 2.5 Standard Work Hours and Time Sheets  
The standard work week consists of forty (40) hours between 12:01AM Monday and 12:00AM midnight the following Sunday. The normal work day starts at 8:00 AM and typically ends at 5:00PM, with lunch from 12:00PM noon to 1:00PM. If for any reason a “no work” day is declared, all exempt, full-time employees may receive their normal compensation at management’s discretion.

From time to time, schedules may be changed to meet project scheduling or other needs. Under these circumstances, notice will be given as far in advance as possible.

An employee’s time sheet is a legal record of the hours he/she is at work. Compensation is based on the time recorded on the employee’s time sheet. Each employee is responsible for the accuracy of his/her time sheet.

### 2.6 Job Descriptions  
At NAL, job descriptions are used to aid in staffing, wage and salary administration, and training. However, job descriptions are not contracts and are not fixed company policy; they are only guidelines and can be expected to change from time to time at the company’s discretion.

### 2.7 Duties  
Each employee shall devote his/her entire working time, attention, and energies to the business of NAL, and shall assume such further responsibilities and perform such duties as may be assigned to him/her from time to time by the company. Employees shall not engage directly or indirectly in any conflicting business activity requiring personal service, or which otherwise interferes with performance of duties for NAL.

### 2.8 Duty Not to Divulge Corporate Information  
Employees owe NAL a duty of confidentiality and loyalty. The employee shall not, at any time during his/her employment, or for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, divulge to any individual or company any matters relating to NAL, or to its clients and customers.

### 2.9 Ideas, Developments, Patents, Inventions, Etc.  
NAL can acquire the ownership of the employee’s inventions and patents if:

1) the employee is hired to develop/create inventions and product improvements,
2) the invention is related to the performance of the employee’s job; and/or
3) the invention is made or developed during billable work hours (time recorded on a NAL time sheet); or while using NAL tools or facilities and/or any portion of NAL finances.
NOTE: Facilities refers to any property secured, obtained, owned and/or leased by NAL.

### 2.10 Performance Appraisals  
Normally, each employee will receive a performance appraisal every twelve (12) months. The performance appraisal allows the company to discuss overall performance and summarize both formal and informal performance discussions held throughout the review period. It will review strengths and also point out ways to improve performance.

### 2.11 Promotions; Job Posting  
NAL has a policy of promoting from within, whenever practical, to meet the growth needs of the company. The company will strive to promote the most qualified and experienced individual, based on demonstrated ability, to assume greater responsibility. At the same time, it may be necessary to recruit and hire outside of NAL in order to attract the most qualified individual for a particular opening. Outside recruiting sources are periodically used to fill open positions.

### 2.12 Payment of Placement Fee and/or Relocation Fees  
If NAL pays any person, agency, or bureau, a fee for placing the employee with the company and said employment is terminated by the employee within twelve (12) months from his/her date of hire, the employee agrees to reimburse NAL for all charges and fees paid by the company to said person, agency, or bureau.
If NAL pays any relocation fees, such as moving costs, temporary lodging, meals, rental, etc. for the employee as a condition of initial employment, and the employment is terminated by the employee, or by NAL, for cause within twelve (12) months of the first day of full-time employment, then the employee agrees to reimburse NAL all said charges and fees paid by NAL.

### 2.13 Resignation  
Before deciding to leave NAL, please discuss your concerns with a corporate officer first. It is an important decision, and there might be factors you may not have considered. Of course, if you have an opportunity that is just too good to pass up, we congratulate you and offer our best wishes for your success. When you resign, your continuous service with NAL is ended; if you should ever rejoin NAL, you will start as a new employee of the company.

Please advise a corporate officer (in writing) at least two (2) weeks prior to your date of departure (unless stated otherwise in your employee agreement) so that an orderly transition can be made. This process includes turning in NAL property, completing required forms, and obtaining appropriate clearances.

### 2.14 Exit Interviews  
In most cases, when an employee leaves NAL, an exit interview will be conducted with a corporate officer on or before the last day of employment. The exit interview documents the reason for separation and solicits constructive feedback to improve NAL.

### 2.15 Office Temperature  
Finding an office temperature that all personnel agree is comfortable is difficult due to variances in ceiling height, proximity to a drafty door or window, and differences in office attire. It has been decided that an average temperature of seventy (70) degrees Fahrenheit should provide a comfortable working temperature for most personnel year-round. In an effort to decrease the heat-loss and drafts in the building, curtains and blinds should be closed each evening during the winter months.

### 2.16 Visitors  
All non-employees must have a company escort while on the premises. If an employee is expecting a visitor, advance notice should be given to the office staff.

### 2.17 Issuance of Keys  
Keys to the NAL facilities shall only be issued to employees by a corporate officer. Each employee shall be responsible for the return of any key issued to them and shall report any key that becomes missing. No employee shall allow a duplicate to be made of any key issued to them or to allow their keys to be used by another person.

### 2.18 Company Equipment  
Use of any NAL equipment and materials shall be limited to company purposes. The care and maintenance of company-owned equipment is the responsibility of all employees. Keep the equipment clean and report any damages to a corporate officer.

### 2.19 Telephone/Voice Mail Use  
NAL telephones are to be used for business purposes in serving the interests of our clients and in the course of normal company operations. Answer all calls promptly and courteously. On occasion, personal calls may be necessary, but we ask for the cooperation of all employees to limit these calls to emergencies or essential personal business and in keeping them brief.

### 2.20 Computer Hardware/Software Security  
NAL equipment, including computer hardware and software, are valuable assets. They must be used for company business only. An employee may not copy or use any software that has been purchased/leased by NAL contrary to the provisions of the contract or without prior approval from a corporate officer.

When an employee is on personal leave, business trips or otherwise absent, said employee’s immediate supervisor may access their computer or files to better serve customers and other business needs. Anticipate this need, and do not expect information left on a company computer or within company files to be totally private.
 
## 3.0 WAGE AND SALARY POLICIES  

### 3.1 Wage or Salary Increase Policy  
Established wage and/or salary levels are reviewed annually, along with the company’s financial status, and are adjusted as necessary. More frequent reviews may occur based on special circumstances determined by management. “Satisfactory” or “Above Average” reviews are necessary for salary increase consideration.

### 3.2 Overtime Pay  
Authorized overtime hours will be paid to non-exempt employees. Authorization must be obtained from a member of management in advance of hours worked. Non-exempt employees will be paid time and one-half for authorized hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in one week.

### 3.3 Payroll Deductions  
Various payroll deductions are made during each pay period to comply with federal and state laws pertaining to taxes and insurance. Deductions will be made for the following:

• Federal and State Income Tax Withholding  
• Social Security (FICA)  
• Other items designated by the employee  

At the end of each calendar year, each employee will be supplied with their Wage and Tax Statement (W-2) Form. This statement summarizes income and deductions for the year. If you have any questions regarding these deductions, please contact a corporate officer.

### 3.4 Time Sheets  
In order for NAL to process payroll and to supply verification of time billed to our mobile laboratory clients, each employee must adhere to the following procedures:

##### 3.4.1 Bi-Monthly Time Cards  
It is the responsibility of each employee to fill out and turn in to a corporate officer a time card for time worked in that pay period. Time worked will be calculated in increments of no less than one-quarter (1/4) hour when processing payroll.

For Mobile Laboratory Services Only:
It is the responsibility of each employee working on a mobile laboratory project site to record time worked on-site in the project notes. Time worked shall be recorded in increments of no less than one-quarter (1/4) hour as this is how payroll will be processed.


In the event that a project’s duration is longer than a given pay period, the employee on-site shall submit to a corporate officer a total of hours worked on-site (to be calculated from the project notes) at the end of each pay period. If the project duration is shorter than a given pay period, the employee shall copy the recorded hours worked on-site (to be calculated from the project notes) onto his/her time card in the home office.

##### 3.4.2 Holiday Hours  
Holiday includes all hours not worked due to a holiday observed by NAL (refer to section 4.7).

##### 3.4.3 Personal Leave  
NAL has a personal leave program for exempt, full-time employees and is accrued on a semi-monthly basis as follows:

| Year(s) Of Employment | Personal Leave Earned/Pay Period | Total/Year |  
| -----| --- | --- |
| 1 – 2| 0.5 | 12 |  
| 3 – 5 | 0.75 | 18 |  
| 6+ | 1.0 | 24 |  

### 3.5 Profit Sharing Bonus Compensation  
At the discretion of the company President NAL, will provide bonus compensation to employees as a means of rewarding outstanding corporate performance. The overall company profit & loss statement as per the corporate tax return will determine the bonus compensation each employee will receive, and this practice will happen no more than once per annum. Profit Sharing and/or Bonus is not a promise or guarantee.

### 3.6 Paydays  
Employees are paid semi-monthly on the fifteenth (15th) and the last working day of each month. In order to allow sufficient time to process the time sheets and to prepare payroll, there is an approximate two (2) week delay in receiving a paycheck. If a payday occurs on a Saturday or Sunday, payment will take place on the preceding Friday. If a payday occurs on an observed holiday, payment will take place on the first workday preceding the holiday.
 
## 4.0 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND SERVICES  
NAL strives to provide a competitive package of employee benefit programs for its eligible employees.

Complete and official details of insurance and payroll plans are contained in materials which employees receive on their first day of employment. The descriptions in this Employee Handbook are only brief summaries for your general information. Employees should contact a corporate officer for more details.

The existence of these employee benefits and plans, in and of themselves, does not signify that an employee will be employed for the requisite time necessary to qualify for these benefits and plans.

### 4.1 Group Insurance  
NAL makes available and will pay up to $300.00 per month for the cost of health insurance premiums for full-time employees and their dependent family members. These insurance benefits become effective on the ninety-first (91st) day of full-time employment. For more details and official terms of these plans, refer to the group insurance Schedule of Benefits summary, which each employee will receive approximately thirty (30) days subsequent to employment.

### 4.2 Social Security  
All employees are covered by the Federal Social Security Act. A required percentage of the employee’s salary is deducted from each paycheck to pay the employee’s portion of this protection, and NAL matches each deduction dollar for dollar. This federal plan is designed for the individuals’ future security and that of his/her dependents and provides for retirement, disability, death, and survivor/Medicare benefits.

### 4.3 State Unemployment Insurance  
This program is funded entirely by employers in this state. The program provides weekly benefits if the employee becomes unemployed through no fault of his/her own or due to circumstances described by law.

### 4.4 Workers’ Compensation  
NAL carries insurance to cover the cost of work-incurred injury or illness. Benefits help pay for medical treatment and part of any income lost while recovering. Specific benefits are prescribed by law depending on the circumstances of each case. To be assured of maximum coverage, work-related accidents must be reported immediately to management and a corporate officer. If necessary, NAL will file a timely claim on the employee’s behalf.

### 4.5 Simple Retirement Plan (IRA)  
This voluntary plan permits eligible employees to defer a portion of their earnings on a pre-tax basis to a savings plan allowed by Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). In order to become a participant, employees must complete six (6) months of full-time employment with NAL, and must be a minimum age of twenty-one (21).

While this plan has important savings and tax advantages, other aspects require careful consideration. Read the special booklet available describing the plan in detail and consult a corporate officer if there are any questions regarding eligibility.

### 4.6 Personal Leave Time  
Regular, exempt, full-time employees accrue time toward their individual personal leave allowance (refer to Section 3.5). Personal leave time can be accrued up to a maximum of one hundred sixty (160) hours. Once your personal leave time reaches one hundred sixty (160) hours, all additionally accrued time is void until the banked hours fall below one hundred sixty (160). Personal leave time does roll over to the next calendar year, and therefore unused personal leave time is not paid out to employees at the end of a year.

Personal leave time for employees with hire dates prior to January 1st, 2008 is paid upon termination for regular, exempt, full-time employees. At termination a corporate officer will issue appropriate funds. There is no payment of personal leave time at termination/resignation for employees with hire dates after January 1st, 2008.

Personal leave must be scheduled and approved by the employee’s immediate supervisor and countersigned by a corporate officer. To ensure that each request is approved and to assure that appropriate staffing can be maintained, the employee must discuss all leave plans in advance with his/her immediate supervisor. Extended leave (multiple day requests) must be scheduled at least one month prior to the requested time. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, employees are discouraged from taking extended leave between April 15th and October 31st.

### 4.7 Holidays  
Exempt and non-exempt, full-time employees are eligible for eight (8) paid holidays in each calendar year. For non-exempt employees, a paid holiday does not count as a day worked in calculating overtime for the week. Holidays that are observed by NAL are as follows:

Holiday Date Observed  
New Year’s Day January 1st  
Good Friday Friday preceding Easter Sunday  
Memorial Day Last Monday in May  
Independence Day July 4th  
Labor Day First Monday in September  
Thanksgiving Fourth Thursday in November  
Friday after Thanksgiving Fourth Friday in November  
Christmas December 25th  

When a company holiday falls on Sunday, the following Monday will be observed as the holiday. If a holiday falls on Saturday, the preceding Friday will be observed as the holiday.

### 4.8 Extenuating Personal Time  
##### 4.8.1 Bereavement  
In the event of death in an employees’ immediate family, up to three (3) working days, with pay, may be granted at the discretion of the immediate supervisor or corporate officer, to handle family affairs. “Immediate family” is defined as: current spouse, children, step-children, siblings, parents, current mother-in-law, or current father-in-law.

In the event of a death in the employee’s extended family, one (1) working day, with pay, may be granted at the discretion of the immediate supervisor or corporate officer, to handle family affairs. “Extended family” is defined as: grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, or cousin.

##### 4.8.2 Jury Duty  
So that employees may serve on a jury without loss of earnings, NAL will pay the difference between the amount of the check received for jury service and normal earnings for the period of jury service not to exceed ten (10) days in any calendar year. If the employee is released from court early and have more than one-half (½) of regularly scheduled hours remaining, the employee must report to work. Please inform management promptly after receiving notification to appear for jury service.

### 4.9 Unpaid Leaves of Absence  
Leaves of absence without pay may be granted by law and/or at NAL’s discretion to eligible employees to maintain continuity of service in instances where unusual or unavoidable circumstances require prolonged absence. The determination for granting such a leave of absence shall be based upon the nature of the request. The employee may be required to use accrued unused personal leave time before being granted a leave of absence. Leaves of absence without pay are of the following types:

Family and Medical Leave - Eligible employees may be granted up to six (6) months of unpaid leave per year for: newborn or newly adopted children, a serious health condition of a child, spouse, or parent, or a serious health condition of their own.
Military Service - For the duration of required service. For details on re-employment rights under the Federal Military Selective Service Act, see a corporate officer.

Military Reserve Training - Up to two (2) weeks per year. It is left up to the employee to utilize paid personal leave time during this time period.

Personal - Up to thirty (30) days for compelling personal reasons. Approval is at the discretion of NAL, management and is based on department work requirements, performance history, and other factors.

Disability - Up to one hundred twenty (120) days for a medical disability. The specific period must be supported by a physician’s statement.

While no loss of service credit occurs during an approved leave of absence, there are other factors to consider such as benefit continuation, reinstatement, and approval processes. For that period of time when an employee is on a leave of absence, fringe benefits paid by NAL, shall be suspended after thirty (30) days. The employee may make arrangements with NAL, to make premium payments on health insurance beyond this 30-day period at the employee’s cost. See a corporate officer for these details.

It is NAL’s policy to reinstate a person after a leave of absence to the same position held at the time the leave of absence began, when possible. If the position is not available at the end of such leave of absence, the person will have the opportunity to be evaluated by NAL, and to be recommended to fill another position, if one exists, or an opening for which they are qualified. If no position is available, or the person does not qualify for an existing position, the person may be placed on layoff status.

If it is determined that an employee has accepted employment elsewhere or the employee fails to return to work after the authorized leave, their employment will be automatically terminated.

### 4.10 Return to Work  
If an employee is on a disability or medical disability leave of absence, said employee must return to work when his/her physician or when a NAL-appointed physician determines ability to resume normal duties. NAL requires a physician’s release before reinstatement to the active payroll. If an employee wishes to extend their leave beyond this point, he/she must apply for a personal leave of absence.

A physician’s release may also be required when returning to work from other short-term, medically-related absences. The employee’s immediate supervisor will advise him/her of this requirement, which depends on case-by-case circumstances.

### 4.11 Education Assistance  
The education assistance program is designed to provide the employee with financial support to pursue specific courses and educational programs which will enhance company skills in current or future work-related areas. Course work must be approved by the company president prior to registration in order to receive reimbursement. Regular, full-time, exempt and non-exempt employees with one or more years of employment may be reimbursed for a portion of tuition costs and enrollment fees for courses taken at a recognized institution at the end of the completed course. If a satisfactory grade (“B” or better) for the course is not earned by the employee, the employee may be required to pay for all costs associated with the completed course. If the employee leaves NAL, or employment is terminated within one (1) year after successful completion of the course and/or payment of professional fees/dues, the employee will be required to reimburse NAL, for all associated costs of the course, fees/dues, etc.

### 4.12 Professional and Technical Organizations and Training  
The decision to join a professional or technical organization rests with each individual. It is his/her responsibility to pay initiation fees and dues. NAL may elect to pay all or a portion of initiation dues and fees to professional and/or technical organizations for employees.

The payment of wages and associated expenses for an employee attending meetings and/or training will be at the discretion of NAL management and will be handled on an individual basis. Prior approval is necessary.

In the normal performance of any job with NAL, there may be times when it is necessary to spend money on behalf of NAL. In the event an employee spends his/her own money on behalf of the company, the employee will be reimbursed for these expenditures after approval is received on a completed Expense Record Form within thirty (30) days of the date of the expenditure. Receipts must be included for all reimbursement expenditures.

##### 4.14.1 Per Diem  
NAL will provide all employees required to be in the field a per diem. In order to qualify for the per diem the project must be more than sixty (60) miles from the company’s home office. Employees will receive full per diem for travel days that are eight (8) hours or more in length, and half (1/2) per diem for travel days greater than four (4) hours and less than eight (8) hours in length.

##### 4.14.2 Long Term Projects  
Mobile Laboratory Projects that exceed one (1) month in length, and where housing is provided with kitchen facilities (refrigerator, stove, and sink) and laundry facilities, will be exempt from NAL’s standard per diem policy.

### 4.15 Company Travel  
Many of the jobs within NAL require travel outside the company’s home office. NAL requires use of company vehicles whenever possible. A valid driver’s license is required in order to operate any company vehicle.

The care and maintenance of NAL vehicles is the responsibility of all employees. Please keep the automobiles clean, smoke free, and report any mechanical difficulties to the fleet manager.

In the event it is necessary to use a NAL vehicle for personal use (going home, etc.), the employee may be required (based on the circumstances) to repay NAL, or have a payroll deduction authorized for mileage utilized at the rate that is in effect at the time of authorization.

If an employee is involved in a traffic accident, report it to the fleet manager and the immediate supervisor as soon as possible, and submit a copy of the police accident report to the fleet manager. Insurance information is maintained in the glove compartment of each vehicle.

If cited for a traffic violation unrelated to a mechanical or procedural deficiency of a company-owned vehicle, the employee will be responsible for paying any fines and/or damage/repair costs not covered by corporate insurance associated with the violation.

##### 4.15.1 DOT Regulations for Transporting Mobile Laboratories  
NAL operates all mobile laboratory units exceeding 10,000 pounds combined gross vehicle weight rating in complete accordance with Federal DOT regulations. Employees transporting laboratory units exceeding 10,000 pounds must be certified by a medical examiner to meet DOT criteria and possess a valid Class “C” chauffeur license.

### 4.16 Mileage Reimbursement  
If an employee finds it necessary to utilize a personal vehicle, a reimbursement rate of $0.30 per mile will be charged for all mileage incurred utilizing one’s personal vehicle for work-related uses. The recorded mileage must be noted on an Expense Record Form and submitted with the standard time sheet.

### 4.17 Corporate Credit Cards  
NAL corporate credit cards may be issued to those employees who are in the field, or out of the office on business matters.

A specified credit limit will be associated with each credit card and must be used for business purposes only. It is the responsibility of each employee to submit all receipts as soon as possible after use to a corporate office for reconciliation.

Each employee will be required to sign an Authorization Form that allows NAL to deduct any personal or unauthorized charges (and/or interest from said charges) from the employee’s paycheck if it becomes necessary. It is the responsibility of NAL to inform the employee if such a deduction is necessary. Any misuse of this credit card privilege may result in revocation.

## 5.0 EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATIONS  

### 5.1 Communication Posting Area  
A posting area is located in the kitchenette/conference area of the main office. Important company information and official memos will be posted in this area. Postings are to be provided to a corporate officer for approval and posting. Each employee is responsible for regularly reading this information.

### 5.2 Suggestions  
Management encourages employees to suggest methods to improve quality and efficiency in NAL Suggestions should be detailed in order that the system or procedure can be adequately evaluated. If confidentiality is requested regarding any suggestions/improvements, NAL will abide by those requests.

### 5.3 Complaint Handling Procedure  
Under normal conditions, if an employee has a job-related problem, question, or complaint, it should be discussed with the employee’s immediate supervisor. The simplest, quickest, and most satisfactory solution will often be reached at this level.

If the discussion with the employee’s immediate supervisor does not answer the question or resolve the matter, the employee may then present the complaint, in writing, to a corporate officer. When the issue personally involves the immediate supervisor, the employee may choose to bypass that individual and proceed to the next person in authority without fear of reprisal. However, whenever possible, the employee is encouraged to first discuss the issue with his/her supervisor. An employee may seek the advice and guidance of the company’s corporate officer(s) at any time as NAL practices an open-door policy with employees at all levels.

### 5.4 Dispute, Resolution, and Review  
NAL believes that in any organization differences in which a company interprets and applies policies are bound to occur. Discussing and settling differences promptly and fairly will make the company more productive and a better place to work for all employees. If an employee does not agree with the manner in which a policy is interpreted or applied, the employee may (in writing) submit the basis for disagreement to his/her immediate supervisor who will acknowledge its receipt and forward it to the president for review and consideration. The results of the president’s review will be communicated to the employee in writing and made a part of the personnel file. An Arbitration Guidance and Procedures document is maintained in the office for review.

### 5.5 Union-Free Employee Relations  
NAL strongly believes it is in the interests of the employees, and the company, to remain union-free. Therefore, NAL will do whatever it can, within the law, to inform employees of the benefits (especially competitiveness, flexibility and communication) that a union-free workplace brings.

### 5.6 Media Relations  
Much of the information we work with is confidential or sensitive; thus, all contacts with the media must be referred to the President or his designated representative. All papers, articles, speeches, or presentations to non-company persons must be approved by a corporate officer prior to publication or presentation.
 
### 6.0 EMPLOYEE SAFETY AND HEALTH  
NAL strives to provide safe working conditions for our employees. Safety regulations of the governments within whose jurisdictions we operate are observed. No person will knowingly be allowed or required to work in any unsafe manner. Safety is every employee’s responsibility, and all employees are expected to do everything reasonable and necessary to keep NAL a safe place to work.

Standard safety rules are made available through NAL’s Hazard Communication Program, and each employee is responsible to become familiar with them and observe them at all times.

### 6.1 Fires and Emergencies  
-- ***IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, DIAL 911*** --

NAL does have an emergency procedure to follow in the event of fire or disaster. Emergency exits, fire extinguishers, eye wash kits, and first-aid kits are located throughout the facility. Emergency exits and areas around fire extinguishers must be kept clear at all times.

### 6.2 Accidents or Injury  
No matter how insignificant an on-the-job injury may seem when it occurs, employees should immediately notify their supervisor and/or a corporate officer of accident/injury. Failure to report such incidents or injuries may be cause for a disciplinary action.

### 6.3 Life-Threatening Illnesses  
NAL is committed to providing equal opportunity to all employees, including those who have a life-threatening illness (cancer, AIDS, cardio-pulmonary diseases, etc.). We are also committed to providing a safe work environment that meets or exceeds state and federal regulations. Consequently, employees who have a life-threatening illness will be treated like other employees, as long as they meet performance standards, medical, and all other evidence indicates that their condition is not a threat to themselves or others in the workplace.

NAL believes all information regarding an employee with a life-threatening illness must remain private and confidential. We ask all employees to treat employees with a life-threatening illness with compassion and understanding.

### 6.4 Issuance of Safety Equipment  
NAL will supply laboratory staff standard personal protective equipment as needed. These items will remain the property of NAL.



### 6.5 Hazard Communication Program  
A corporate Hazard Communication Program has been designed by NAL to inform employees of policies and procedures that will help us continually strive for a safe and healthy work environment. The Hazard Communication Program details the various regulatory requirements applicable to NAL and is intended to ensure the protection (both on- and off-site) of all NAL personnel. The Hazard Communication Program incorporates and is consistent with state and federal regulations.
 
## 7.0 STANDARDS OF CONDUCT AND CORRECTIVE ACTION  
Groups of people working together, for any purpose, require certain guidelines pertaining to conduct and relationships. Accordingly, all employees must be aware of their responsibilities to NAL and to their co-workers.

NAL strives to take a constructive approach to disciplinary matters ensuring that actions which interfere with company operations or an employee’s job are not continued.

NAL reserves the right to search an employee’s personal effects such as tool boxes, desks, lockers, etc., on NAL premises. Any search of personal effects will be conducted by the employee’s supervisor or a corporate officer in addition to a witness. The witness may be another employee, supervisor or corporate officer. Return of company equipment or company distributed materials may be required. Employees are expected to comply with all requests. Non-compliance will result in corrective action up to or including termination.

Violations of standards will result in one of the following forms of corrective action: termination, suspension without pay, or written warning. In arriving at a decision for proper action, the following will be considered:

• The seriousness of the infraction  
• The past record of the employee  
• The circumstances surrounding the matter  

There is no way to identify every possible violation of standards of conduct. A partial list of infractions which will result in corrective action is as follows:

• Falsifying an employment application, time sheet, personnel file, or other NAL documents or records.  
• Using, possessing, distributing, purchasing, or selling a controlled substance(s) while on NAL premises or while engaged in professional services to a client.  
• Reporting to and/or performing work for NAL under the influence of a controlled substance(s) or alcohol.  
• Unauthorized possession of NAL or other employee property, gambling, weapons or explosives, or violating criminal laws on NAL or client-owned premises.  
• Fighting, throwing objects, horseplay, practical jokes, or other disorderly conduct which may endanger the well-being of any person on NAL premises.
• Engaging in acts of dishonesty, fraud, theft, or sabotage.  
• Threatening, intimidating, coercing, using abusive language, or interfering with the performance of other employees.  
• Insubordination or refusal to comply with instructions or failure to perform reasonable duties which are assigned.  
• Damaging or destroying NAL property due to careless acts.  
• Conduct which NAL feels reflects adversely on the employee or NAL.  
• Performance which, in NAL’s opinion, does not meet the requirements of the position.  
• Engaging in such other practices as NAL determines may be inconsistent with the ordinary and reasonable rules of conduct necessary to the welfare of NAL, its employees, or its clients.  
• Negligence in observing fire prevention and safety rules.  
• Other circumstances for which NAL feels that corrective action is warranted.  

This list is intended to only be a sampling of the types of activities which may result in disciplinary action. It is not intended to be comprehensive and does not alter the employment-at-will relationship between the employee and NAL.

### 7.1 Conflict of Interest  
We expect our employees to conduct business according to the highest ethical standards of conduct. Employees are expected to devote their best efforts to the interests of NAL and the conduct of its affairs. Business dealings that create, or appear to create, a conflict between the interests of NAL and an employee are unacceptable. NAL recognizes the right of employees to engage in activities outside of their employment which are of a private nature and unrelated to our business. However, a policy of full disclosure must be followed to assess and prevent potential conflicts of interest from arising. Contact a corporate officer if you have questions regarding possible conflicts.

### 7.2 Harassment  
Every NAL employee has the right to a workplace free from harassment. Harassment of anyone on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, age, sex, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, marital status or other protected categories is prohibited by law and by the policies of this company.

Harassment can include such behavior as slurs, demeaning jokes or comments, innuendoes, unwelcome compliments, cartoons, pictures, pranks, gestures, stereotypical comments, derogatory descriptions or other verbal or physical conduct. Behavior is considered harassment when it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment; unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance; and/or affects an individual’s workplace opportunities.

Sexual harassment occurs when the verbal or physical conduct described above is sexual in nature or gender-based. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other conduct of a sexual nature; making submission to or rejection of such conduct the basis for employment decisions; and/or creating an intimidating, offensive or hostile working environment by such conduct.

Any employee who believes that he or she has been the subject of unwelcome harassment from another employee, a supervisor or manager, or from an outside party in the workplace, or who has observed harassment in the workplace, is encouraged to identify the offensive behavior and request that it stop. If you are unable to address the matter directly with the harasser, or if you do and the behavior continues, report the matter directly to your immediate supervisor or another member of the management team.

All complaints will be investigated promptly, impartially, and discreetly. Upon completion of the investigation, the appropriate parties will be notified of the findings. If any employee is found by the company to have harassed another employee, appropriate corrective action will be taken. This could range from a disciplinary warning, training or reassignment to suspension or termination. Management will also take prompt remedial action to prevent or stop harassment of employees on the job by vendors, customers or other third parties.

No employee will suffer retaliation for reporting in good faith alleged instances of harassment. Employees and management must work together to prevent and stop harassing conduct in the workplace.

We trust all employees to act responsibly to maintain a safe workplace, to treat each other with dignity and respect, and to work to maintain a workplace free of discrimination and harassment.

### 7.3 Attendance Standards  
Punctuality and regular attendance are essential to the proper operation of any business. These also help the employee to establish a good working reputation and will be considered at his/her annual review.

If an employee is unable to report for work for any reason, will arrive late, or must leave early, notification must be made to his/her immediate supervisor before the workday (in the event of absence or tardiness), or as early as possible (to leave early).

### 7.4 Absence Without Notice  
To operate our business effectively employees must keep the company informed of his/her status when off work because of illness or accident. Failure to notify the company of status after three (3) days of consecutive absence will be considered a resignation, and the employee will be removed from the payroll effective the last day of attendance. Likewise, employees must call his/her immediate supervisor daily while off work due to short-term illness or accident, or it will be presumed the employee has resigned. The employee will be removed from the payroll. If an employee must leave work for any reason before the end of the day, please inform your immediate supervisor.

### 7.5 Solicitation and Distribution  
Soliciting by one employee of another, or collecting from one employee by another, is prohibited while either employee is on work time. Distributing literature and circulating petitions during work time or in work areas at any time is also prohibited. Trespassing, soliciting, or distributing literature by anyone outside NAL is prohibited on NAL’s premises. Solicitation includes email, telephone calls, and handbills.

### 7.6 Alcohol and Drugs  
NAL is a drug-free environment and recognizes that alcohol and drug abuse in any work place is a major concern. We believe that by reducing drug and alcohol use the safety, health, and productivity of employees will be improved. The object of NAL’s alcohol and drug policy is to provide a safe and healthy work place for all employees, to comply with federal and state health and safety regulations, and to prevent accidents and/or injuries.

The policy prohibits NAL employees or NAL subcontractors from:

• Using, possessing, distributing, purchasing, or selling drugs or alcohol while on NAL premises or while engaged in NAL business.  
NOTE: An exception may be made regarding alcohol at company-authorized functions.  
• Reporting to and/or performing work for NAL under the influence of unauthorized drugs or alcohol.  

NAL may conduct drug and alcohol testing of an employee under the following circumstances:  

Pre-Employment Testing - All applicants for employment, at NAL’s discretion, are required to submit to laboratory testing following their acceptance of a contingent job offer and prior to beginning work (drug screen only).

Reasonable Suspicion Testing - When responsible officials have reasonable suspicion to believe an employee is in violation of NAL’s drug and alcohol policy.  

NAL defines a safety sensitive position as one in which the employee can directly influence operations to the extent that an improper action or failure to take appropriate action could result in injury or death of employees or others and/or property or environmental damage and where others may have no opportunity to recognize, intervene, or rectify a mistake before the harm occurs.

Violation of the NAL drug and alcohol policy constitutes just cause for termination of the employee.

### 7.7 Confidentiality  
During the course of employment with NAL employees will be working with clients, client lists, business systems, future plans, research and development data, and other information that is considered confidential. Maintaining confidentiality is important to the company’s competitive position in the industry and ultimately, to the ability to achieve financial success and provide employment stability. Protect this information by safeguarding it when in use, filing it properly when not in use, and discussing it only with those who have a legitimate business need to know.

### 7.8 Dress and Personal Appearance  
All NAL staff are expected to adhere to an internal dress code policy. This policy has been developed in an effort to maintain and project professionalism within the firm to co-workers, to members of our current and potential client base, and within the business community in general. Personal attire not only impacts others’ perceptions, but also affects the individuals’ professional performance.

New Age/Landmark dress code requires either corporate logoed shirts or jacket when working on-site, appropriate pants or skirts, appropriate footwear, as well as any required and/or assigned personal protective equipment when in the laboratory. All staff are expected to wear clothing appropriate for planned activities, job responsibilities (adherence to the Chemical Hygiene Plan is a must for employees working in a laboratory), and weather conditions.

Sandals, cut-off shorts, sweat pants, and torn or soiled clothing are not acceptable for any staff, whether in the office or in the laboratory. At no time should bandanas or dew rags be worn. Please note that if you choose not to adhere to this dress code policy, you will be asked to leave work and change into appropriate attire using personal time, not company time.

### 7.9 Smoking  
For reasons of safety, public relations, and other concerns, smoking is prohibited in NAL laboratory facilities, at job sites, and in all company vehicles (the laboratories and vehicles contain expensive equipment that must be kept as clean and pollutant-free as possible).
