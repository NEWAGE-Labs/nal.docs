# Terms and Definitions

### Computer Architecture

> A Computer Architecture is a particular style or convention used to build a Turing-Complete machine. Most personal computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones are built either using a 32-bit architecture based on Intel's x86 series design, or a 64-bit architecture based on AMD's 64-bit design. However, there are other architectures based on different designs, including some built from Peptide reactions.

### Operating System

> An Operating System is a set of machine instructions used to allow a human to easily control and interact with a computer architecture. Most Operating Systems are either 32-bit or 64-bit depending on which style of computer architecture](#computer-architecture) they were designed to operate with.

### Microsoft

> Microsoft is an extremely large organization that provides a wide range of software tools and services. They are our software provider for Windows, [Office 365](Office 365.md), and [SQL Server](SQL Server.md).

# Current Version

Currently NAL uses Windows 10 for all personnel and instrument [workstations](Workstations.md) except where an older version is required or [Ubuntu](Ubuntu.md) can be used instead. It is also used for the main office domain controller and [file server](Servers.md#file-server).
