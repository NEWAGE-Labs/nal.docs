# 3 Terms and Definitions #

## Referenced Documents of Terminology ##
For the purposes of this manual, the following documents and their corresponding definitions apply: ISO/IEC 17000; ISO/IEC Guide 30; ISO Council Committee on Conformity Assessment (CASCO); ISO 9000; ISO 5725-1; ISO/IEC 17025:2017; AOAC; International Vocabulary of Basic and General Terms in Metrology (VIM); and NELAC 2009.

## Defined Terms ##

##### Accreditation ######
>Formal recognition of a laboratory by an independent science-based organization that the laboratory is competent to perform specific tests (CASCO).

##### Accuracy #####
>The nearness of a result or the mean of a set of results to the true value. Accuracy is assessed by means of reference samples and percent recoveries.

##### Aliquot #####
>A measured portion of a sample taken for analysis

##### Analyte #####
>The chemical element or compound an analyst seeks to determine; the chemical element of interest.

##### Analytical Batch #####
>The basic unit for analytical quality control is the analytical batch. The analytical batch is defined as samples that are analyzed together with the same method sequence and the same lots of reagents and with the manipulations common to each sample within the same time period or in continuous sequential time periods. Samples in each batch should be of similar composition.

##### Analytical Sample #####
>Any solution or media introduced into an instrument, on which an analysis is performed, excluding instrument calibration, initial calibration verification, initial calibration blank, continuing calibration verification, and continuing calibration blank. The following are all analytical samples: undiluted and diluted samples, pre-digestion spike samples, duplicate samples, serial dilution samples, analytical spike samples, post digestion spike samples, interference check samples, laboratory control sample, preparation blank, and linear range analysis sample (LRS).

##### Area #####
>A term used in gas chromatography that indicates the peak area of a compound exiting a chromatographic column. The size or area of the peak is proportional to the amount of analyte in the sample.

##### Bias #####
>A systematic (consistent) error in test results. Bias is expressed as the difference between the population mean and the true or reference value, or as estimated from sample statistics, the difference between the sample average and the reference value.

##### Blank #####
>A blank is an artificial sample designed to monitor the introduction of artifacts into the process. For aqueous samples, reagent water is used as a blank matrix; however, a universal blank matrix does not exist for solid samples, and therefore, no matrix is used. There are several types of blanks, which monitor a variety of processes: - A method blank is taken through sample preparation and analysis only. It is a test for contamination in the laboratory procedure. – A storage blank is stored and analyzed with samples at the laboratory. It is a test for contamination in sample storage as well as sample preparation and analysis. – A trip blank is shipped to and from the field with the sample containers. It is not opened in the field and, therefore, provides a test for contamination from sample preservation, site conditions, and transport as well as sample storage, preparation, and analysis. It is most commonly used for volatile organics. – A field blank is opened in the field and tests for contamination from the atmosphere as well as those activities listed under trip blank.

##### Calibration #####
>The systematic determination of the relationship of the response of the measurement system to the concentration of the analyte of interest. Instrument calibration performed before any samples are analyzed is called continuing calibration. Calibration is also the act of making a scheduled comparison of instrument performance against national standards for instruments which measure physical parameters such as mass, time, and temperature.

##### Calibration Curve #####
>The graphical relationship between the known values for a series of calibration standards and instrument responses.

##### Calibration Check Standard #####
>A verification of the ratio of instrument response to analyte amount. A calibration check is done by analyzing a standard solution of known analytes in an appropriate solvent matrix.

##### Calibration Standard #####
>A material used to quantitate the relationship between the output of a sensor and a property to be measured. Calibration standards should be traceable to Standard Reference Materials (provided by NIST, EPA, or other recognized standards agencies) or a primary standard.

##### Chain of Custody (COC) #####
>Procedures and associated documents designed to trace the custody of a sample from the point of origin to final disposition, with the intent of legally demonstrating that custody remained intact and that tampering or substitutions were precluded.

##### Chromatogram #####
>A graph representing the signal output of an instrument (GC or HPLC) which can be used to identify organic chemicals by peak retention time (RT) and to quantitate by peak size.

##### Check Sample #####
>A blank that has been spiked with the analyte(s) from an independent source in order to monitor the performance of the analytical method. The level of
the spike will be at the regulatory action level when applicable. Otherwise, the spike will be at five (5) times the estimate of the quantification limit. The matrix
used will be phase-matched with the samples and well characterized, i.e., reagent grade water is appropriate for an aqueous sample.

##### Coefficient of Variation (Relative Standard Deviation) #####
>A measure of precision (relative dispersion). It is equal to the standard deviation divided by the mean and multiplied by 100 to give a percentage value.

##### Co-elution #####
>When two organics determined by GC give the same retention time (RT) and cannot be differentiated.

##### Comparability #####
>Expresses the confidence with which one data set can be compared to another data set measuring the same property. Comparability is assured through the use of established and approved analytical methods, consistency in the basis of analysis (wet weight, volume, etc.) and consistency in reporting units (ppm, ppb, etc.).

##### Completeness #####
>The amount of valid data obtained from a measurement system compared to the amount that was expected to be obtained under correct normal operations. It is usually expressed as a percentage.

##### Composite #####
>A sample composed of two or more increments.

##### Concentration #####
>The amount of chemical (analyte) present per amount of sample. For trace analyses, usually expressed as ppm, ppb, or ppt.

##### Decafluorotriphenylphosphine (DFTPP) #####
>An organic compound utilized in several GC/MS methods to establish proper mass spectral instrument performance for semi- volatile analyses.

##### Dry Weight #####
>The weight of a sample based on percent solids. Also, the weight of a sample after drying in an oven at a specified temperature.

##### Equipment Blanks #####
>Aliquots of reagent grade water poured appropriately over or through the sample collection device, collected in a sample container, and returned to the mobile laboratory as a sample. Equipment blanks ensure sampling device cleanliness. For projects involving soil gas analysis, equipment blanks consist of ambient air drawn through the collection equipment.

##### Environmental or Field Sample #####
>A representative sample of any material (aqueous, non- aqueous, or multimedia) collected from any source for which determination of composition or contamination levels is requested or required. For the purposes of this manual, environmental samples will be classified as follows:

>1. Surface Water and Ground Water.
>2. Drinking Water - delivered (treated or untreated) water designated as potable water.
>3. Water/Wastewater - raw source water for public drinking water supplies, ground waters, municipal influents/effluents, and industrial influents/effluents.
>4. Sludge - municipal sludges and industrial sludges.
>5. Waste - Aqueous and non-aqueous liquid wastes, chemical solids, contaminated soils, and industrial liquid and solid wastes.

These procedures are reviewed and revised according to referenced document [*Quality System Procedure - Document Control and Management*](QSPs/Document Control and Management.md).

#### 6.4.8 Calibration Status ####

Equipment under the control of the laboratory and requiring calibration, or having a defined period of validity, is labeled or coded to indicate the calibration status or period of validity. Alternatively, equipment calibration status may be identified in an associated record (such as an electronic record within the LIMS) to indicate the status of calibration.

![Calibration Tag](imgs/calibration_tag.png)

Measuring equipment that has failed calibration or is deemed out of service is labeled with one of the following labels, or an appropriate electronic indicator:

![Calibration Void](imgs/calibration_void.png)   ![Calibration Out of Service](imgs/calibration_out_of_service.png)  

A piece of equipment that is not calibrated or checked is labeled with the following label or a suitable electronic alternative:

![Calibration For Reference Only](imgs/calibration_for_reference_only.png)  

Calibration labels have a write-on surface and a pressure sensitive adhesive. The areas that are filled out include the person who performed the calibration, the date it was performed, the date it is due for re-calibration, and the equipment’s identification number. Electronic records are maintained by authorized  personnel, and available to everyone performing tasks involving the equipment.

#### 6.4.9 Out of Service ####

Equipment that has been subjected to overloading or mishandling, gives suspect results, or has been shown to be defective or outside specified limits is taken out of service, clearly marked, and appropriately stored until it has been repaired and shown by calibration or test to perform correctly.

The laboratory examines the effect of the defect or departure from specified limits on previous tests, sampling, or calibrations, and consequently institutes the “Control of Nonconforming Work” procedure as outlined in [**Section 7.10 - Nonconforming Work.**](#nonconforming_work).

#### 6.4.10 Calibration Confirmation ####

When intermediate checks are needed to maintain confidence in the calibration status of equipment, these checks are carried out periodically according to procedures in the [*Quality System Procedure - Equipment*](QSPs/Equipment.md).

#### 6.4.11 Correction Factors ####

Where calibrations or reference material data include reference values or correction factors, these are implemented in accordance with specified requirements. Additional details on the updating and implementation of correction factors can be found in the [*Quality System Procedure - Equipment*](QSPs/Equipment.md).

#### 6.4.12 Safeguards ####

Test and calibration equipment, including both hardware and software, are safeguarded from adjustments that would invalidate the test or calibration results. Safeguards are provided by controlling access to laboratory equipment, and using password protected software in a controlled network.

## 6.5 Metrological Traceability ##

#### 6.5.1 Establishing and Maintaining Metrological Traceability ####

The program for calibration of equipment demands that calibrations and measurements made by the laboratory are traceable to the International System of Units.

Calibration laboratories providing services to the laboratory are to provide evidence of measurement traceability of their own measurement standards and measuring instrument to the SI. This is done by means of an unbroken chain of calibration or comparisons linking them to primary standards of the SI units of measurement. Such primary standards are those used by national measurement standards.  

Calibration certificates issued by calibration laboratories are to include the measurement results, including the measurement uncertainty and a statement of conformance with an identified metrological specification. Additional information on how measurement uncertainty is determined from each contributing measurement can be found in the [*Quality System Procedure - Measurement Uncertainty*](QSPs/Measurement Uncertainty.md).

#### 6.5.2 Ensuring Measurement Results are Traceable ####

Information about traceability to the International System of Units (SI) can be found in the [*Quality System Procedure - Metrological Traceability*](QSPs/Metrological Traceability.md).

<!--###### (a) ######

Calibration laboratories providing services to the laboratory are to provide documentation demonstrating measurement capability and competence to perform the calibration services requested by the laboratory. ISO 17025:2017 accredited laboratories are assumed to be competent.

###### (b) ######

The measurement integrity of internal reference materials generated by the laboratory is evaluated against either standard reference materials or certified reference materials from an independent source when it is technically and economically possible. If an internal reference material is not used, a certified reference material from a competent producer with stated metrological traceability to the SI is used. ISO 17034 accredited producers are assumed to be competent.

###### (c) ######

The measurement traceability to SI units may be achieved by measurements related to national measurement standards. National measurement standards may be used as primary standards that are primary realizations of the SI units or agreed representations of SI units. National measurement standards based on fundamental physical constants, or standards calibrated by another national metrological institute may be use as primary standards.-->

#### 6.5.3 Non-traceability of Reference Standards to SI Units ####

Calibrations that cannot provide strict measurement traceability to SI units are conducted such that the calibration results can provide confidence in the measurements made in the course of the analyses. Traceability alternatives to SI units are described in the [*Quality System Procedure - Metrological Traceability*](QSPs/Metrological Traceability.md).
