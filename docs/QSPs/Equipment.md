## Scope and Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to define proper laboratory equipment management by defining the requirements for handling, transport, storage, calibration, verification, maintenance, and safeguards for onsite equipment. Additionally, equipment outside the laboratory's permanent control that is used to produce results that will be reported by the laboratory shall be managed with a program commensurate to the program detailed herein. 

Deviation to the requirements of this document must be approved by either the Quality Assurance Officer or Technical Director and should be documented to include the nature of the deviation, justification, samples affected, approval, and date. Deviation documentation must be retained as a record for a period of time equivalent to any affected sample's record retention requirements.

## Terms and Definitions

Equipment: any tool or device used by laboratory personnel to produce laboratory reported values, or values that may impact laboratory reported values.

## Equipment Handling


## Equipment Storage and Transport
Equipment shall be stored in the proper working environment as defined by equipment vendor manuals. When new equipment is placed in service, equipment vendor manuals shall be reviewed for storage requirements. These storage requirements shall be added to the equipment SOP and adhered to unless technical justification is documented.

Equipment calibration / function may be affected by equipment transport. Sensitive equipment (e.g., balances) should not be moved from their place of calibration. When transporting equipment, ensure care is taken to minimize potential for equipment damage and personnel injury. Post-transport, equipment should not be used unless all method specific quality control verifications are performed and within acceptable limits (see [Equipment Verification](#Equipment-Verification)).

## Equipment Calibration
Equipment calibrations shall be conducted in accordance with the established method using standards with the appropriate traceability. 

Typically, calibrations will include a minimum of at least 3 calibration points for linear calibrations and 5 calibration points for non-linear calibrations. The type of calibration and points used for calibration should align with the testing performed for method validation and the approved operating procedure for that method. 

Calibrations shall be evaluated for accuracy upon completion. Unless otherwise justified through the method validation process, satisfactory calibration will exhibit a correlation coefficient >= 0.995. Additionally, some method SOP's may require other post-calibration verifications such as back-calculating individual calibration response data to ensure the best-fit line is within acceptance criteria (e.g., <=10%)

New equipment calibrations should not be used unless all method specific quality control verifications are performed post-calibration and within acceptable limits (see [Equipment Verification](#Equipment-Verification)).

## Equipment Verification

## Equipment Maintenance
Equipment maintenance should be performed at the manufacturer's recommended periodicity or regulatory document's recommended periodicity whichever is shorter unless technical justification is documented.

More...table for maintenance periodicity here...

Equipment maintenance, both preventative and corrective, shall be documented in an equipment specific maintenance log. The maintenance log should detail the maintenance performed, date, and individual performing the maintenance. This log should contain both maintenance performed by laboratory personnel and visitors performing maintenance.

## Equipment Safeguards

## Specific Equipment Requirements
### pH Meter
Accuracy and scale graduations should be within +/-0.1 pH units

pH buffer aliquots should be used only once for drinking water analyses

Electrodes should be maintained according to manufacturer recommendations

Standardization should be performed daily prior to use with buffers bracketing the expected range of sample analysis. The date, analyst, and buffers used should be recorded in the equipment maintenance record.

pH meter slope should be recorded in the equipment maintenance log post-calibration. If the pH slope is outside 95% to 105% the electrode may need maintenance. Follow manufacturer's instructions.

Commercial buffer solution containers should be dated upon receipt and when opened. Buffers should be discarded by the expiration date.
### Conductivity Meter
Meter must be suitable for checking reagent-grade water and readable in units of µmho/cm or µS/cm.

Meter shall be calibrated at least monthly following manufacturer's recommendations and using an appropriate certified and traceable low-level standard (<20µmho/cm). If the meter cannot be calibrated at least monthly then the cell constant should be determined monthly in accordance with Standard Methods 2510. Calibrations should be recorded in the equipment maintenance log.

If an inline conductivity cell cannot be calibrated it should no be used to check reagent grade water.
### Balance
Balances should have readability of 0.1g if used for microbiological drinking water analysis and 0.0001g if used for chemical drinking water analysis.

Balances should be verified daily using at least three ASTM Class 1, 2, or 3 non-reference weights. For balances used for microbioligical drinking water analysis, a sensitivity check should be performed by adding a 0.1g weight to the upper check point. Non-reference weights should be validated at least every 6 months with reference weights. Correction values should be on file and used. A reference weight should be recertified at least every 5 years. Damaged or corroded weights should be replaced.

Maintenance, calibration, and cleaning should be conducted at least annually by a qualified independent technician. Calibrations should be performed using ASTM Type 1, Class 1 or 2 weights. 
### Temperature Monitoring Device
Glass, dial, or electronic thermometers used for microbiological drinking water analysis must be graduated to 0.5°C increments (0.2°C increments for tests which are incubated at 44.5°C) or less except as specifically noted for refrigerators. The fluid column in thermometers should not be separated.

Liquid bearing thermometers such as mercury or alcohol thermometers need to be traceable to NIST calibration and verified at least annually and whenever the thermometer has been exposed to temperature extremes. The correction factor and date of calibration should be indicated on the thermometer and maintained as part of the equipment maintenance log. If a thermometer's correction factor is greater than 1°C then it should not be used for microbiological drinking water analysis. The NIST traceable thermometer should be recalibrated at least on per 5 years. Thermometer verification records must include:

1. Serial number of laboratory thermometer
2. Serial number of NIST-traceable thermometer
3. Temperature of laboratory thermometer
4. Temperature of NIST-traceable thermometer
5. Correction factor
6. Date of check
7. Analyst's initials

Digital thermometers, thermocoupes, and other similar electronic temperature measuring devices should be calibrated at least quarterly. The date the thermometer was calibrated and the calibration factor shoudl be kept and be available for inspection.

Infrared thermometers should be verified at least every six months using a NIST certified thermometer over the full temperature range that the IR thermometer will be used. Each day of use a single check of the IR should be made by cehcking the temperature of a bottle of water at the temperature of interest that contains a calibrated thermometer. Agreement between the two should be within 0.5°C or the device should be recalibrated.
### Incubator Unit
Incubator units must have an internal temperature monitoring device and maintain the temperature specified by the method used, usually 35+/-0.5°C and 44.5+/-0.2°C. For non-portable incubators, thermometers should be placed on the top and bottom shelves of the use area and immersed in liquid as directed by the manufacturer (except for electronic thermometers).

Calibration-corrected temperature should be recorded daily (twice per day with at least 4 hours between readings for microbiological drinking water analysis) for each incubator in-use. Documentation must include the date, time, temperature, and technician's initials.
### Refrigerator
Refrigerators should maintain a termperature of 1°C-5°C. Calibrated thermometers shoudl be graduated in at least 1°C increments and the thermometer bulb immersed in liquid. 

On days the refrigerator is in use and the laboratory is staffed the calibration-corrected temperature, date, time, and technician's initials should be recorded at least once per day.
### Autoclave
The autoclave should have an internal heat source, a temperature gauge with a sensor on the exhaust, a pressure gauge, and an operational safety valve. The autoclave should maintain a sterilization temperature during the sterilizing cycle and complete an entire cycle within 45 minutes when a 12-15 minute sterilization period is used. The autoclave should depressurize slowly enough to ensure that media will not boil over and bubbles will not form in inverted tubes.

Pressure cookers should not be used for sterilization.

Each time the autoclave is used, the date, contents, sterilization time and temperature, total time in the autoclave, and analyst's initials should be recorded. Service contract work and maintenance records shall be maintained.

A maximum-temperature-registering thermometer, electronic temperature readout device, or continuous recording device shoulbe used during each autoclave cycle to ensure that the proper termperature was reached, and the temperature recorded. Overcrowding should be avoided. Spore strips or spore ampules should be used at least monthly as bioindicators to confirm sterilization. Note that chemical indicators (e.g., autoclave tape) will respond to a wide range of times and temperatures (longer time lower temperature or shorter time higher temperature). Therefore, chemical indicators should not be used to show that sterilization has occurred.

Automatic timing mechanisms should be checked quarterly with a stopwatch or other accurate timepiece and the results recorded in the equipment history log.

Door seals should be clean and free of carmelized media. Autoclave drain screens should be cleaned frequently and debris removed.
### Pipets
To sterilize and maintain sterility of glass pipets, stainless steel or aluminum canisters shoudl be used, or individual pipets should be wrapped in char-resistant paper or aluminum foil.

Pipets should have legible markings and should not be chipped or etched.

Opened packs of disposable sterile pipets shoudl be resealed between use periods.

Pipets delivering volumes of 10 ml or less must be accurate to within a 2.5% tolerance if used for microbiological drinking water analysis.

Calibrated micropipetters may be used for microbiological drinking water analysis if tips are sterile. These micropipetters should be calibrated annually and adjusted or replaced if the precision or accuracy is greater than 2.5%
### Glassware / Plasticware

### Sample Containers

### Ultraviolet Lamp
The lamp should be disconnected monthly and cleaned.
### Color Standards
Wavelength settings on spectrophotometers should be verified at least annually with color standards and records retained with the equipment's maintenance log and be available for inspection.
