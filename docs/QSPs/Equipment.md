## Scope and Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to define proper laboratory equipment management by defining the requirements for handling, transport, storage, calibration, verification, maintenance, and safeguards for onsite equipment. Additionally, equipment outside the laboratory's permanent control that is used to produce results that will be reported by the laboratory shall be managed with a program commensurate to the program detailed herein. 

Deviation to the requirements of this document must be approved by either the Quality Assurance Officer or Technical Director and should be documented to include the nature of the deviation, justification, samples affected, approval, and date. Deviation documentation must be retained as a record for a period of time equivalent to any affected sample's record retention requirements.

## Terms and Definitions

Equipment: any tool or device used by laboratory personnel to produce laboratory reported values, or values that may impact laboratory reported values.

## Equipment Handling


## Equipment Storage and Transport
Equipment shall be stored in the proper working environment as defined by equipment vendor manuals. When new equipment is placed in service, equipment vendor manuals shall be reviewed for storage requirements. These storage requirements shall be added to the equipment SOP and adhered to unless technical justification is documented.

Equipment calibration / function may be affected by equipment transport. Sensitive equipment (e.g., balances) should not be moved from their place of calibration. When transporting equipment, ensure care is taken to minimize potential for equipment damage and personnel injury. Post-transport, equipment should not be used unless all method specific quality control verifications are performed and within acceptable limits (see [Equipment Verification](#Equipment-Verification)).

## Equipment Calibration
Equipment calibrations shall be conducted in accordance with the established method using standards with the appropriate traceability. 

Typically, calibrations will include a minimum of at least 3 calibration points for linear calibration curves and 5 calibration points for non-linear calibration curves. The type of calibration curve and points used for calibration should align with the testing performed for method validation and the approved SOP governing operation of the equipemnt. 

Calibrations shall be evaluated for accuracy upon completion. Unless otherwise justified in through the method validation process, satisfactory calibration will exhibit a correlation coefficient >= 0.995. Additionally, some method SOP's may require other post-calibration verifications such as back-calculating individual calibration response data to ensure the best-fit line is within acceptance criteria (e.g., <=10%)

New equipment calibrations should not be used unless all method specific quality control verifications are performed post-calibration and within acceptable limits (see [Equipment Verification](#Equipment-Verification)).
