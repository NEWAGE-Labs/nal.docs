## Scope and Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to define proper laboratory equipment management by defining the requirements for handling, transport, storage, calibration, verification, maintenance, and safeguards for onsite equipment. Additionally, equipment outside the laboratory's permanent control that is used to produce results that will be reported by the laboratory shall be managed with a program commensurate to the program detailed herein. 

Deviation to the requirements of this document must be approved by either the Quality Assurance Officer or Technical Director and should be documented to include the nature of the deviation, justification, samples affected, approval, and date. Deviation documentation must be retained as a record for a period of time equivalent to any affected sample's record retention requirements.

## Terms and Definitions

Equipment: any tool or device used by laboratory personnel to produce laboratory reported values, or values that may impact laboratory reported values.

## Equipment Handling


## Equipment Storage and Transport
Equipment shall be stored in the proper working environment as defined by equipment vendor manuals. When new equipment is placed in service, equipment vendor manuals shall be reviewed for storage requirements. These storage requirements shall be added to the equipment SOP and adhered to unless technical justification is documented.

Equipment calibration / function may be affected by equipment transport. Sensitive equipment (e.g., balances) should not be moved from their place of calibration. When transporting equipment, ensure care is taken to minimize potential for equipment damage and personnel injury. Post-transport, equipment should not be used unless all method specific quality control verifications are performed and within acceptable limits (see [Equipment Verification](#Equipment-Verification)).

## Equipment Calibration
Equipment calibrations shall be conducted in accordance with the established method using standards with the appropriate traceability. 

Typically, calibrations will include a minimum of at least 3 calibration points for linear calibration curves and 5 calibration points for non-linear calibration curves. The type of calibration curve and points used for calibration should align with the testing performed for method validation and the approved SOP governing operation of the equipemnt. 

Calibrations shall be evaluated for accuracy upon completion. Unless otherwise justified in through the method validation process, satisfactory calibration will exhibit a correlation coefficient >= 0.995. Additionally, some method SOP's may require other post-calibration verifications such as back-calculating individual calibration response data to ensure the best-fit line is within acceptance criteria (e.g., <=10%)

New equipment calibrations should not be used unless all method specific quality control verifications are performed post-calibration and within acceptable limits (see [Equipment Verification](#Equipment-Verification)).

## Equipment Verification

## Equipment Maintenance
Equipment maintenance should be performed at the manufacturer's recommended periodicity or regulatory document's recommended periodicity whichever is shorter unless technical justification is documented.

Equipment maintenance, both preventative and corrective, shall be documented in an equipment specific maintenance log. The maintenance log should detail the maintenance performed, date, and individual performing the maintenance. This log should contain both maintenance performed by laboratory personnel and visitors performing maintenance.

## Equipment Safeguards

## Specific Equipment Requirements
### pH Meter
Accuracy and scale graduations should be within +/-0.1 pH units

pH buffer aliquots should be used only once for drinking water analyses

Electrodes should be maintained according to manufacturer recommendations

Standardization should be performed daily prior to use with buffers bracketing the expected range of sample analysis. The date, analyst, and buffers used should be recorded and maintained as a record.

pH meter slope should be recorded post-calibration. If the pH slope is outside 95% to 105% the electrode may need maintenance. Follow manufacturer's instructions.

Commercial buffer solution containers should be dated upon receipt and when opened. Buffers should be discarded by the expiration date.
### Balance
Balances should have readability of 0.1g if used for drinking water analysis.

Balances should be checked at least once every 31 days using at least three ASTM Class 1, 2, or 3 non-reference weights. During calibration a sensitivity check should be performed by adding a 0.1g weight to the upper check point. Non-reference weights should be validated at least every 6 months with reference weights. Correction values should be on file and used. A reference weight should be recertified at least every 5 years. Damaged or corroded weights should be replaced.

Balances should be calibrated at least annually...(section 7 of EPA GL's)
