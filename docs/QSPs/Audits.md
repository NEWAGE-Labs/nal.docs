## Purpose and Scope  

The purpose of this [Quality System Procedure](../index.md#quality-system-procedure-qsp) is to expand upon the [Quality System Manual](../index.md) in regards to [Audits](#audit). This document provides details of audit-related terminology, guidance on how NAL categorizes and utilizes [Audits](#audit), details about the different Audit Plans that NAL employs, and reference to training requirements and criteria for various functions of auditing.

There is also a dedicated [SOP for Internal Audits](../SOPs/Management/Internal Audits.md) and [SOP for External Audits](../SOPs/Management/External Audits.md) that go beyond the scope of this QSP.

## Terms and Definitions  

###### Audit

>A systematic, independent and documented process for obtaining [objective evidence](#objective-evidence) and evaluating it objectively to determine the extent to which the [audit criteria](#audit-criteria) are fulfilled.  

###### Internal Audit

>An [audit](#audit) conducted by NAL on behalf of itself. Also known as a 'First Party Audit'.  

###### External Audit

>An [audit](#audit) conducted by an independent organization on a NAL mangement system, or conducted by NAL on an independent organization's management system. External audits conducted by customers or interested parties are also known as 'Second Party Audits' while external audits conducted for compliance and certification are known as 'Third Party Audits'.

###### Combined Audit

> An internal or external [audit](#audit) on two or more [management systems](#management-systems)

###### Joint Audit

> An internal or external [audit](#audit) by two or more auditing organizations.

###### Audit Program

> A list of one or more pre-planned audits including the [audit scope](#audit-scope) of each audit.

###### Audit Scope

>The extent of a [management system](#management-system) to which an individual audit will cover, including details such as location, organizations involved, processes covered, and time frame.  

###### Audit Plan

>A description of the activities and arrangements for an individual [audit](#audit), including details such as attending personnel, itineraries, and technical considerations.  

###### Audit Objective

>A functional goal or purpose in performing an [audit](#audit). Objectives can include reviewing documentation, re-evaluating uncertainty, identifying risks, discovering opportunity for improvement, following up on a previous corrective action to ensure compliance, or something else relevant to the quality or operation of a [mangement system](#management-system).

###### Audit Criteria

>The set of [requirements](#requirement) used as a reference against which [objective evidence](#objective-evidence) is compared. [Requirements](#requirement) may include policies, procedures, work instructions, legal requirements, and contractual obligations. "Compliance" or "Non-Compliance" are often used in an [audit finding](#audit-finding) based on the type of criteria used.

###### Objective Evidence

>Data supporting the existence or verity of something. Objective evidence can be obtained through observation, measurement, test, or by other means. Objective evidence for the purpose of an [audit](#audit), also known as [Audit Evidence](#audit-evidence) generally consists of records or other verifiable information relevant to the [audit criteria](#audit-criteria).

###### Audit Evidence

>Records, statements of fact, or other information, which are relevant to the [audit criteria](#audit-criteria) and verifiable.

###### Audit Finding

>The results of evaluating collected [audit evidence](#audit-evidence) against [audit criteria](#audit-criteria). Audit findings indicate [Conformity](#conformity) or [Nonconformity](#nonconformity), and can lead to the identification of risks, opportunities for improvement, or recording good practices.

###### Audit Conclusion

>The outcome of an [audit](#audit), after consideration of the [audit objectives](#audit-objectives) and all [audit findings](#audit-finding).

###### Audit Report
