## Purpose

To estimate the uncertainty of measurement in a test method.

## Scope / Field of Application

All measurements from test methods, except when the test methods preclude such rigorous calculations.

Note – It is important to understand the major factors of uncertainty and provide appropriate control for all such factors. Concurrent analysis of reference materials or control samples with the test portion can be performed in place of purely mathematical estimation of uncertainty. If possible, the reference material or control sample shall be of identical or similar matrix as the matrices routinely tested by the test method. The uncertainty of the method can be estimated for the class of matrix and the variation described as the uncertainty in testing the specific matrix class at the average amount of analyte detected.

## Definitions and Acronyms

> Type A Uncertainty – determined through calculation from a series of repeated observations using statistical methods.

> Type B Uncertainty – determined through judgment, based on data in calibration certificates, previous measurement data, experience with the behavior of the instruments, manufacturer’s specifications, and all other relevant information.

> Uncertainty of Measurement – parameter associated with the result of a measurement that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurand.

## Procedure

Step 1. Specification
Write down a clear statement of what is being measured, including the relationship between the measurement and the parameters (e.g., measured quantities, constants, calibration standards, etc.) upon which it depends. Where possible, include corrections for known systematic effects. The specification information, if it exists, is normally given in the relevant standard operating procedure (SOP) or other method.

Step 2. Identify Uncertainty Sources
List the possible sources of uncertainty. This will include sources that contribute to the uncertainty on the parameters in the relationship specified in Step 1, but may include other sources and must include sources arising from chemical assumptions. Examples for forming a structured list are given in the appendix.

Step 3. Quantify Uncertainty Components
Measure or estimate the size of the uncertainty component associated with each potential source of uncertainty identified. It is often possible to estimate or determine a single contribution to uncertainty associated with a number of separate sources. It is also important to consider whether available data accounts sufficiently for all sources of uncertainty, and plan additional experiments and studies carefully to ensure that all sources of uncertainty are adequately accounted for.

Step 4. Calculate Total Uncertainty
The information obtained in step 3 will consist of a number of quantified contributions to overall uncertainty, whether associated with individual sources or with the combined effects of several sources. The contributions have to be expressed as standard deviations, and combined according to the appropriate rules, to give a combined standard uncertainty. The appropriate coverage factor should be applied to give an expanded combined uncertainty.


## Alternate Procedure

Concurrently analyze reference materials or control samples with test samples to estimate uncertainty. This is generally achieved during validation of methods.
