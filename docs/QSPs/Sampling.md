## Scope and Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to expand upon the Quality System Manual, and give direction to the process of sampling.

## Sampling Guides:

Sample Protocol guides exist for each matrix and analysis profile that NEW AGE performs. These can be found under the list of [Sampling SOPs](../SOPs/index.md#sampling).

## Authorization

Sampling must be carried out by an authorized sampler. In most cases, the client is sufficient to sample their own samples as they are the ones requesting the test. However, in some cases a sampling expert is required.

Sampling experts must be trained and authorized according to the sampling protocol they are performing, and must be supervised by another personnel member with competency, or by a 3rd-party expert.

## Sampling Records

Records of sampling are maintain on the chain-of-custody documents, or additional documents accompany the sample delivery group.
