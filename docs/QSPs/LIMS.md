## Scope and Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to expand upon the [Quality System Manual](../index.md) to give additional direction on the usage of electronic data systems and an overall laboratory information management system (LIMS)

## NALIMS

A large portion of NEW AGE Laboratories is managed by the Plone and Senaite-based content management tool, NALIMS. This software application is available inside the office build by visiting http://lims/ on any device inside the office. Credentials are required. For more details, see the SOPs on the NALIMS.

## File Server

NEW AGE personnel actively utilize a file server hosted on a windows 2016 server. This file server is backed up and has revision history, as well as an Active Directory of all active NEW AGE personnel. For more information on the file server and how windows operates, see the SOPs for [Servers](../SOPs/Software and Computers/Servers.md) and [Windows](../SOPs/Software and Computers/Windows.md)

## Git and GitHub

NEW AGE's controlled documentation is maintained using the version control system **Git**. NEW AGE also makes use of the web utility **GitHub**. Documentation is hosted on GitHub using MkDocs. For more information, see the SOPs on [Git](../SOPs/Software and Computers/Git.md), [GitHub](../SOPs/Software and Computers/GitHub.md), and [MkDocs](../SOPs/Software and Computers/MkDocs.md).
