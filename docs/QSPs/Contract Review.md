B.	Objective / goals / required information
Requested analysis:
- Qualitative / semi-quantitative, limit of detection:
- Quantitative, range of concentration:

C.	Costs
Expected costs:
Cost limits:

D.	Date of completion / schedule
Date of intermediate results / reports:
Deadline for final results / report:

E.	Sampling

Date of sampling:
Source / producer:
Responsible person:
Number of samples:

F.	Description of sample(s)
Identification:

Reference materials / reference samples:

G.	Methodology

2.	This information is reviewed to determine the laboratory’s ability to perform the work requested by the customer. If the laboratory has the technical capabilities and resources, continue this procedure. Otherwise inform the customer that the laboratory is unable to fulfill their request.

3.	Quotations for routine requests can be quickly provided through the standard price list.

4.	Quotations for non-routine requests take more time to cost out and are formally issued as a service quotation document. This is typically faxed to the customer. Each new service quotation is assigned a unique number.


Acceptance of a Contract

1.	The customer sends back the service quotation with their signature within the acceptance period and/or a purchase order referring to the service quotation.

2.	When a customer submits samples without written authorization and the submission form requests the previously discussed services, a confirmation fax is sent to the customer informing them that the work will be performed as proposed.

3.	When a customer submits samples without written authorization and the submission form requests services that are different from the original service quotation, the customer is contacted to clarify the required testing and to obtain written authorization to proceed.

4.	When a customer submits samples without any prior discussion (re: required testing and pricing), the customer is contacted, requirements are reviewed, and a service quotation is issued to clarify the request and provide pricing.


Contract Amendment

1. Amendments to a contract are reviewed in the same manner as previously outlined.
