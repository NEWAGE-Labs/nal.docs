Accreditation Formal recognition of a laboratory by an independent science-based organization that the laboratory is competent to perform specific tests (CASCO). Accuracy The nearness of a result or the mean of a set of results to the true value. Accuracy is assessed by means of reference samples and percent recoveries. Aliquot A measured portion of a sample taken for analysis Analyte The chemical element or compound an analyst seeks to determine; the chemical element of interest. Analytical Batch The basic unit for analytical quality control is the analytical batch. The analytical batch is defined as samples that are analyzed together with the same method sequence and the same lots of reagents and with the manipulations common to each sample within the same time period or in continuous sequential time periods. Samples in each batch should be of similar composition. Analytical Sample Any solution or media introduced into an instrument, on which an analysis is performed, excluding instrument calibration, initial calibration verification, initial calibration blank, continuing calibration verification, and continuing calibration blank. The following are all analytical samples: undiluted and diluted samples, pre-digestion spike samples, duplicate samples, serial dilution samples, analytical spike samples, post digestion spike samples, interference check samples, laboratory control sample, preparation blank, and linear range analysis sample (LRS). Area A term used in gas chromatography that indicates the peak area of a compound exiting a chromatographic column. The size or area of the peak is proportional to the amount of analyte in the sample. Bias A systematic (consistent) error in test results. Bias is expressed as the difference between the population mean and the true or reference value, or as estimated from sample statistics, the difference between the sample average and the reference value. Blank A blank is an artificial sample designed to monitor the introduction of artifacts into the process. For aqueous samples, reagent water is used as a blank matrix; however, a universal blank matrix does not exist for solid samples, and therefore, no matrix is used. There are several types of blanks, which monitor a variety of processes: - A method blank is taken through sample preparation and analysis only. It is a test for contamination in the laboratory procedure. \u2013 A storage blank is stored and analyzed with samples at the laboratory. It is a test for contamination in sample storage as well as sample preparation and analysis. \u2013 A trip blank is shipped to and from the field with the sample containers. It is not opened in the field and, therefore, provides a test for contamination from sample preservation, site conditions, and transport as well as sample storage, preparation, and analysis. It is most commonly used for volatile organics. \u2013 A field blank is opened in the field and tests for contamination from the atmosphere as well as those activities listed under trip blank. Calibration The systematic determination of the relationship of the response of the measurement system to the concentration of the analyte of interest. Instrument calibration performed before any samples are analyzed is called continuing calibration. Calibration is also the act of making a scheduled comparison of instrument performance against national standards for instruments which measure physical parameters such as mass, time, and temperature. Calibration Curve The graphical relationship between the known values for a series of calibration standards and instrument responses. Calibration Check Standard A verification of the ratio of instrument response to analyte amount. A calibration check is done by analyzing a standard solution of known analytes in an appropriate solvent matrix. Calibration Standard A material used to quantitate the relationship between the output of a sensor and a property to be measured. Calibration standards should be traceable to Standard Reference Materials (provided by NIST, EPA, or other recognized standards agencies) or a primary standard. Chain of Custody (COC) Procedures and associated documents designed to trace the custody of a sample from the point of origin to final disposition, with the intent of legally demonstrating that custody remained intact and that tampering or substitutions were precluded. Chromatogram A graph representing the signal output of an instrument (GC or HPLC) which can be used to identify organic chemicals by peak retention time (RT) and to quantitate by peak size. Check Sample A blank that has been spiked with the analyte(s) from an independent source in order to monitor the performance of the analytical method. The level of the spike will be at the regulatory action level when applicable. Otherwise, the spike will be at five (5) times the estimate of the quantification limit. The matrix used will be phase-matched with the samples and well characterized, i.e., reagent grade water is appropriate for an aqueous sample. Coefficient of Variation (Relative Standard Deviation) A measure of precision (relative dispersion). It is equal to the standard deviation divided by the mean and multiplied by 100 to give a percentage value. Co-elution When two organics determined by GC give the same retention time (RT) and cannot be differentiated. Comparability Expresses the confidence with which one data set can be compared to another data set measuring the same property. Comparability is assured through the use of established and approved analytical methods, consistency in the basis of analysis (wet weight, volume, etc.) and consistency in reporting units (ppm, ppb, etc.). Completeness The amount of valid data obtained from a measurement system compared to the amount that was expected to be obtained under correct normal operations. It is usually expressed as a percentage. Composite A sample composed of two or more increments. Concentration The amount of chemical (analyte) present per amount of sample. For trace analyses, usually expressed as ppm, ppb, or ppt. Decafluorotriphenylphosphine (DFTPP) An organic compound utilized in several GC/MS methods to establish proper mass spectral instrument performance for semi- volatile analyses. Dry Weight The weight of a sample based on percent solids. Also, the weight of a sample after drying in an oven at a specified temperature. Equipment Blanks Aliquots of reagent grade water poured appropriately over or through the sample collection device, collected in a sample container, and returned to the mobile laboratory as a sample. Equipment blanks ensure sampling device cleanliness. For projects involving soil gas analysis, equipment blanks consist of ambient air drawn through the collection equipment. Environmental or Field Sample A representative sample of any material (aqueous, non- aqueous, or multimedia) collected from any source for which determination of composition or contamination levels is requested or required. For the purposes of this manual, environmental samples will be classified as follows: Surface Water and Ground Water. Drinking Water - delivered (treated or untreated) water designated as potable water. Water/Wastewater - raw source water for public drinking water supplies, ground waters, municipal influents/effluents, and industrial influents/effluents. Sludge - municipal sludges and industrial sludges. Waste - Aqueous and non-aqueous liquid wastes, chemical solids, contaminated soils, and industrial liquid and solid wastes. Extract The solution (liquid) remaining after a sample has been contacted with an aqueous solution (for inorganics) or an organic solvent (for organics). The extract, containing the chemical of interest, is then processed and analyzed by AA, ICP, or wet chemical techniques (inorganics and metals) or by GC/MS, or HPLC (organics). Extraction The process of isolating chemicals of interest from a sample matrix (e.g., water, soil) when the sample cannot be analyzed directly. Field Blanks A blank that is prepared and handled in the field and analyzed in the same manner as its corresponding client samples.

Linear Regression A statistical method for finding a straight line that best fits a set of two or more data points, thus providing a relationship between two or more variables. Mass Spectrum A line graph representing the relative abundance of the ions based on the collisions with the mass spectrometer detector. Based on the data and distribution of the ions the masses, molecules and isotopes may be determined. Matrix The component or substrate that contains the analyte(s) of interest. Examples of matrices are water, soil, sediment, and air. Matrix is not synonymous with phase (liquid or solid). Matrix Effect Interference in the measurement of analyte(s) in a sample that is caused by materials in the sample. Matrix effects may cause elevated reporting limits or may prevent the acquisition of acceptable results. Matrix Spike (MS) An aliquot of a matrix fortified sample spiked with known quantities of specific compounds and subjected to an entire analytical procedure. The percent recovery for the respective compound(s) is a measure of accuracy. Matrix/Spike Duplicate (MSD) A second aliquot of the same matrix as the matrix spike (above) that is spiked in order to determine the precision of the method. Mean The average of a set of values. Median The middle value of a set of data when the data set is ranked in increasing or decreasing order. Method Blank (MB) An analytical control consisting of all reagents, which may include internal standards and surrogate standards that are carried through the entire analytical procedure. The method blank is used to define the level of laboratory background contamination.

Any value less than MRC is annotated as: <MRC. PAHs (PNAs) Polyaromatic hydrocarbons, also called PNAs (polynuclear aromatics). A class of hydrocarbons that contain fused benzene rings. In the Air program, these compounds are frequently referred to as Polycyclic Organic Mater (POM). Percent Difference When two independent measurements of the same characteristics are available, it is possible to use the percent difference instead of the coefficient of the variation to measure precision. Percent Recovery (%R) A measure of accuracy determined from the comparison of a reported spike value to its true spike concentration. Petroleum Hydrocarbon Fingerprinting A technique for identifying sources of petroleum products. ppb Part-per-billion. A unit of measurement that expresses the amount of chemical present (\u2018part\u2019) per the amount of sample analyzed (\u2018billion\u2019). For example, a \u2018ng\u2019 (nanogram or one billionth of a gram) per \u2018g\u2019 (gram) of sample is 1ppb. More common units are \u00b5g/Kg (micrograms per kilogram for solids) and \u00b5g/L (micrograms per liter for liquids). ppm Part-per-million. A unit of measurement that expresses the amount of chemical present (\u2018part\u2019) per the amount of sample analyzed (\u2018million\u2019). For example, a \u2018\u00b5g\u2019 (microgram or one millionth of a gram) per \u2018g\u2019 (gram) of sample is 1 ppm. More common units are mg/Kg (milligrams per kilogram for solids) and mg/L (microgram per liter for liquids). Precision The reproducibility of an analytical technique, usually measured by analysis of duplicates of duplicate spikes. Precision is usually expressed in terms of relative standard deviation or relative percent difference, but can be expressed in terms of the variance, range, or other statistic. Practical Quantification Limit (PQL) The lowest level that can be reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions. Quality Management System The collective quality management system of the laboratory including documents, procedures, and LIMS components used for the implementation of an ISO/IEC 17025 and NELAC accredited system. Quality Management Team The group of laboratory management responsible for oversight and implementation of this Quality System Manual and the quality management system. This group consists of the: President VP Laboratory Operations Executive Assistant IT Director Quality System Records The collection of paper documents, electronic files, raw data, and data structures that record laboratory operations. These records are maintained and reviewed for accuracy and completeness. Records found to be inaccurate or incomplete must be addressed with an immediate corrective action. Raw Data All documentation associated with the original recording of analytical results pertinent to a specific sample or set of samples. This may include laboratory worksheets, calculation forms, instrument-generated output, analyst notes, etc., from sample receipt through final reporting. Reagent Blank A reagent blank is an aliquot of analyte-free water or solvent analyzed with the analytical batch. Reagent Grade Synonymous term for reagents which conform to the current specifications of the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society. Relative Percent Difference (RPD) Statistic for evaluating the precision of a replicate set. Replicate Sample A sample prepared by dividing it into two or more separate aliquots. Duplicate samples are considered to be two replicates. Resolution The degree of separation between peaks elution from a chromatographic column. Sufficient resolution between peaks is required for proper quantitation of unknown analytes. Response Factor (RF) A factor derived from the calibration of a compound that is used in the quantitation calculation of sample analytes. A response factor may be derived from an external standard calibration (then called a Calibration Factor) or from an internal standard calibration (then called a Relative Response Factor). Retention Time A term used in gas and liquid chromatography describing the time elapsed from sample injection until the specific compound elutes or exits the chromatographic column at the detector. Each compound has a characteristic retention time on a specific column; therefore, this information is used to qualitatively identify the compounds in the sample. Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM) A technique in which one or more specific ions are monitored. Because only specific ions are monitored, selected ion monitoring generally provides higher sensitivity than a full scan monitoring. A term applicable only to GC/MS. Semi-Volatile Organics Organic chemicals which generally contain six to thirty carbon atoms and are amenable to GC, GC/MS or HPLC analysis. Solid Waste Non-liquid, non-soluble, materials, ranging from municipal garbage to industrial wastes that contain complex, and sometimes hazardous, substances. Solid wastes include sewage, sludge, agricultural refuse, demolition wastes, mining residues, and even liquids, and gases in containers. Standard Curve A curve that plots concentrations of known analyte standards versus the instrument response to the analyte. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) A detailed written description of how a laboratory executes a particular procedure or method, in order to standardize its performance. Stock Solution A concentrated solution of analyte(s) or reagent(s) prepared and verified by prescribed procedure(s), and used for preparing working standards or standard solutions. Sub-sample A portion taken from a sample. A laboratory sample may be a sub-sample of a gross sample; similarly, test portion may be a sub-sample of a laboratory sample. Surrogate Compounds that are added to every blank, sample, laboratory control spike, laboratory control spike duplicate, matrix spike, and matrix spike duplicate. They are used to evaluate analytical efficiency by measuring recovery. Surrogates include brominated, flouorinated or isotopically labeled compounds that are not expected to be detected in environmental samples. Target Compounds Specific compounds that are to be quantified in a sample. Target compound lists are based upon client needs and scope of work. Traceability The ability of an analytical standard material used for instrument calibration purposes to be traced to its source. The standards must be traceable via written documentation to sources which produce or sell verified or certified standards, i.e., National Institute for Standards and Technology, USEPA, or vendors preparing standards from those sources which they have certified. Traceability also applies to the syringes, columns and other analytical equipment. NAL maintains the certifications for all equipment in the corporate headquarters. Trip Blanks A sample, usually pure water prepared in the lab, which is taken to the sampling site and then returned with the collected samples. Later analysis will indicate any false positive results in the real samples arising from contamination during shipment. Water (Reagent, Analyte-Free, or Laboratory Grade) Distilled or de-ionized water or Type II reagent water that is free of contaminants that may interfere with the analytical tests in question. \\newpage 4 General Requirements 4.1 Impartiality 4.1.1 Laboratory Impartiality Laboratory activities shall be undertaken impartially and are structured and managed so as to safeguard impartiality. 4.1.2 Management Impartiality The laboratory's quality management team shall be committed to impartiality.

Calibration laboratories providing services to the laboratory are to provide evidence of measurement traceability of its own measurement standards and measuring instrument to the SI. This is done by means of an unbroken chain of calibration or comparisons linking them to primary standards of the SI units of measurement. Such primary standards are those used by national measurement standards. Calibration certificates issued by calibration laboratories are to include the measurement results, including the measurement uncertainty and a statement of conformance with an identified metrological specification. 6.5.2 Ensuring Measurement Results are Traceable (a) Calibration laboratories providing services to the laboratory are to provide documentation demonstrating measurement capability and competence to perform the calibration services requested by the laboratory. (b) A reference material is a homogeneous and well characterized substance used for standardization of equipment used in the testing process. Reference materials are traceable to national or international standard reference materials (SRMs), such as National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), or certified reference materials (CRMs) from competent suppliers of reference materials. The measurement integrity of internal reference materials generated by the laboratory is evaluated against either standard reference materials or certified reference materials from an independent source when it is technically and economically possible. (c) The measurement traceability to SI units may be achieved by measurements related to national measurement standards. National measurement standards may be used as primary standards that are primary realizations of the SI units or agreed representations of SI units. National measurement standards based on fundamental physical constants, or standards calibrated by another national metrological institute may be use as primary standards. 6.5.3 Non-traceability of Reference Standards to SI Units Calibrations that cannot provide strict measurement traceability to SI units are conducted such that the calibration results can provide confidence in the measurements made in the course of the analyses.
