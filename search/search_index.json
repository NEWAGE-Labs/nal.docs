Defined Terms Accreditation Formal recognition of a laboratory by an independent science-based organization that the laboratory is competent to perform specific tests (CASCO). Accuracy The nearness of a result or the mean of a set of results to the true value. Accuracy is assessed by means of reference samples and percent recoveries. Aliquot A measured portion of a sample taken for analysis Analyte The chemical element or compound an analyst seeks to determine; the chemical element of interest. Analytical Batch The basic unit for analytical quality control is the analytical batch. The analytical batch is defined as samples that are analyzed together with the same method sequence and the same lots of reagents and with the manipulations common to each sample within the same time period or in continuous sequential time periods. Samples in each batch should be of similar composition. Analytical Sample Any solution or media introduced into an instrument, on which an analysis is performed, excluding instrument calibration, initial calibration verification, initial calibration blank, continuing calibration verification, and continuing calibration blank. The following are all analytical samples: undiluted and diluted samples, pre-digestion spike samples, duplicate samples, serial dilution samples, analytical spike samples, post digestion spike samples, interference check samples, laboratory control sample, preparation blank, and linear range analysis sample (LRS). Area A term used in gas chromatography that indicates the peak area of a compound exiting a chromatographic column. The size or area of the peak is proportional to the amount of analyte in the sample. Bias A systematic (consistent) error in test results. Bias is expressed as the difference between the population mean and the true or reference value, or as estimated from sample statistics, the difference between the sample average and the reference value. Blank A blank is an artificial sample designed to monitor the introduction of artifacts into the process. For aqueous samples, reagent water is used as a blank matrix; however, a universal blank matrix does not exist for solid samples, and therefore, no matrix is used. There are several types of blanks, which monitor a variety of processes: - A method blank is taken through sample preparation and analysis only. It is a test for contamination in the laboratory procedure. \u2013 A storage blank is stored and analyzed with samples at the laboratory. It is a test for contamination in sample storage as well as sample preparation and analysis. \u2013 A trip blank is shipped to and from the field with the sample containers. It is not opened in the field and, therefore, provides a test for contamination from sample preservation, site conditions, and transport as well as sample storage, preparation, and analysis. It is most commonly used for volatile organics. \u2013 A field blank is opened in the field and tests for contamination from the atmosphere as well as those activities listed under trip blank. Calibration The systematic determination of the relationship of the response of the measurement system to the concentration of the analyte of interest. Instrument calibration performed before any samples are analyzed is called continuing calibration. Calibration is also the act of making a scheduled comparison of instrument performance against national standards for instruments which measure physical parameters such as mass, time, and temperature. Calibration Curve The graphical relationship between the known values for a series of calibration standards and instrument responses. Calibration Check Standard A verification of the ratio of instrument response to analyte amount. A calibration check is done by analyzing a standard solution of known analytes in an appropriate solvent matrix. Calibration Standard A material used to quantitate the relationship between the output of a sensor and a property to be measured. Calibration standards should be traceable to Standard Reference Materials (provided by NIST, EPA, or other recognized standards agencies) or a primary standard. Chain of Custody (COC) Procedures and associated documents designed to trace the custody of a sample from the point of origin to final disposition, with the intent of legally demonstrating that custody remained intact and that tampering or substitutions were precluded. Chromatogram A graph representing the signal output of an instrument (GC or HPLC) which can be used to identify organic chemicals by peak retention time (RT) and to quantitate by peak size. Check Sample A blank that has been spiked with the analyte(s) from an independent source in order to monitor the performance of the analytical method. The level of the spike will be at the regulatory action level when applicable. Otherwise, the spike will be at five (5) times the estimate of the quantification limit. The matrix used will be phase-matched with the samples and well characterized, i.e., reagent grade water is appropriate for an aqueous sample. Coefficient of Variation (Relative Standard Deviation) A measure of precision (relative dispersion). It is equal to the standard deviation divided by the mean and multiplied by 100 to give a percentage value. Co-elution When two organics determined by GC give the same retention time (RT) and cannot be differentiated. Comparability Expresses the confidence with which one data set can be compared to another data set measuring the same property. Comparability is assured through the use of established and approved analytical methods, consistency in the basis of analysis (wet weight, volume, etc.) and consistency in reporting units (ppm, ppb, etc.). Completeness The amount of valid data obtained from a measurement system compared to the amount that was expected to be obtained under correct normal operations. It is usually expressed as a percentage. Composite A sample composed of two or more increments. Concentration The amount of chemical (analyte) present per amount of sample. For trace analyses, usually expressed as ppm, ppb, or ppt. Decafluorotriphenylphosphine (DFTPP) An organic compound utilized in several GC/MS methods to establish proper mass spectral instrument performance for semi- volatile analyses. Dry Weight The weight of a sample based on percent solids. Also, the weight of a sample after drying in an oven at a specified temperature. Equipment Blanks Aliquots of reagent grade water poured appropriately over or through the sample collection device, collected in a sample container, and returned to the mobile laboratory as a sample. Equipment blanks ensure sampling device cleanliness. For projects involving soil gas analysis, equipment blanks consist of ambient air drawn through the collection equipment. Environmental or Field Sample A representative sample of any material (aqueous, non- aqueous, or multimedia) collected from any source for which determination of composition or contamination levels is requested or required. For the purposes of this manual, environmental samples will be classified as follows: Surface Water and Ground Water. Drinking Water - delivered (treated or untreated) water designated as potable water. Water/Wastewater - raw source water for public drinking water supplies, ground waters, municipal influents/effluents, and industrial influents/effluents. Sludge - municipal sludges and industrial sludges. Waste - Aqueous and non-aqueous liquid wastes, chemical solids, contaminated soils, and industrial liquid and solid wastes. Extract The solution (liquid) remaining after a sample has been contacted with an aqueous solution (for inorganics) or an organic solvent (for organics). The extract, containing the chemical of interest, is then processed and analyzed by AA, ICP, or wet chemical techniques (inorganics and metals) or by GC/MS, or HPLC (organics). Extraction The process of isolating chemicals of interest from a sample matrix (e.g., water, soil) when the sample cannot be analyzed directly. Field Blanks A blank that is prepared and handled in the field and analyzed in the same manner as its corresponding client samples.

Mass Spectrum A line graph representing the relative abundance of the ions based on the collisions with the mass spectrometer detector. Based on the data and distribution of the ions the masses, molecules and isotopes may be determined. Matrix The component or substrate that contains the analyte(s) of interest. Examples of matrices are water, soil, sediment, and air. Matrix is not synonymous with phase (liquid or solid). Matrix Effect Interference in the measurement of analyte(s) in a sample that is caused by materials in the sample. Matrix effects may cause elevated reporting limits or may prevent the acquisition of acceptable results. Matrix Spike (MS) An aliquot of a matrix fortified sample spiked with known quantities of specific compounds and subjected to an entire analytical procedure. The percent recovery for the respective compound(s) is a measure of accuracy. Matrix/Spike Duplicate (MSD) A second aliquot of the same matrix as the matrix spike (above) that is spiked in order to determine the precision of the method. Mean The average of a set of values. Median The middle value of a set of data when the data set is ranked in increasing or decreasing order. Method Blank (MB) An analytical control consisting of all reagents, which may include internal standards and surrogate standards that are carried through the entire analytical procedure. The method blank is used to define the level of laboratory background contamination.

For example, a \u2018ng\u2019 (nanogram or one billionth of a gram) per \u2018g\u2019 (gram) of sample is 1ppb. More common units are \u00b5g/Kg (micrograms per kilogram for solids) and \u00b5g/L (micrograms per liter for liquids). ppm Part-per-million. A unit of measurement that expresses the amount of chemical present (\u2018part\u2019) per the amount of sample analyzed (\u2018million\u2019). For example, a \u2018\u00b5g\u2019 (microgram or one millionth of a gram) per \u2018g\u2019 (gram) of sample is 1 ppm. More common units are mg/Kg (milligrams per kilogram for solids) and mg/L (microgram per liter for liquids). Precision The reproducibility of an analytical technique, usually measured by analysis of duplicates of duplicate spikes. Precision is usually expressed in terms of relative standard deviation or relative percent difference, but can be expressed in terms of the variance, range, or other statistic. Practical Quantification Limit (PQL) The lowest level that can be reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions. Reference Material A reference material is a homogeneous and well characterized substance used for standardization of equipment used in the testing process. Reference materials are traceable to national or international standard reference materials (SRMs), such as National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), or certified reference materials (CRMs) from competent suppliers of reference materials. Quality Management System The collection of parts of the laboratory including, but not limited to, this manual, documents, records, procedures, and all LIMS components used for the implementation of a system compliant with ISO/IEC 17025, NELAC, and our company mission.

This group consists of the: President VP Laboratory Operations Executive Assistant IT Director Quality System Manual (QSM) This document. Quality System Procedure (QSP) A documented, recorded, and controlled procedure used to expand the Quality System Manual and provide additional details about components of the Quality Management System . A QSP often will link directly to many Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to expand further upon specific details. Quality System Procedures The collection of QSPs required for accurate and complete implementation of the Quality Management System . These procedures are maintained and reviewed for accuracy and completeness. Procedures found to be inaccurate or incomplete must be addressed with an immediate corrective action. Quality System Records The collection of paper documents, electronic files, raw data, and data structures that record laboratory operations. These records are maintained and reviewed for accuracy and completeness. Records found to be inaccurate or incomplete must be addressed with an immediate corrective action. Raw Data All documentation associated with the original recording of analytical results pertinent to a specific sample or set of samples. This may include laboratory worksheets, calculation forms, instrument-generated output, analyst notes, etc., from sample receipt through final reporting. Reagent Blank A reagent blank is an aliquot of analyte-free water or solvent analyzed with the analytical batch. Reagent Grade Synonymous term for reagents which conform to the current specifications of the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society. Relative Percent Difference (RPD) Statistic for evaluating the precision of a replicate set. Replicate Sample A sample prepared by dividing it into two or more separate aliquots. Duplicate samples are considered to be two replicates. Resolution The degree of separation between peaks elution from a chromatographic column. Sufficient resolution between peaks is required for proper quantitation of unknown analytes. Response Factor (RF) A factor derived from the calibration of a compound that is used in the quantitation calculation of sample analytes. A response factor may be derived from an external standard calibration (then called a Calibration Factor) or from an internal standard calibration (then called a Relative Response Factor). Retention Time A term used in gas and liquid chromatography describing the time elapsed from sample injection until the specific compound elutes or exits the chromatographic column at the detector. Each compound has a characteristic retention time on a specific column; therefore, this information is used to qualitatively identify the compounds in the sample. Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM) A technique in which one or more specific ions are monitored. Because only specific ions are monitored, selected ion monitoring generally provides higher sensitivity than a full scan monitoring. A term applicable only to GC/MS. Semi-Volatile Organics Organic chemicals which generally contain six to thirty carbon atoms and are amenable to GC, GC/MS or HPLC analysis. Solid Waste Non-liquid, non-soluble, materials, ranging from municipal garbage to industrial wastes that contain complex, and sometimes hazardous, substances. Solid wastes include sewage, sludge, agricultural refuse, demolition wastes, mining residues, and even liquids, and gases in containers. Standard Curve A curve that plots concentrations of known analyte standards versus the instrument response to the analyte. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) A detailed written description of how a laboratory executes a particular procedure or method, in order to standardize its performance. Stock Solution A concentrated solution of analyte(s) or reagent(s) prepared and verified by prescribed procedure(s), and used for preparing working standards or standard solutions. Sub-sample A portion taken from a sample. A laboratory sample may be a sub-sample of a gross sample; similarly, test portion may be a sub-sample of a laboratory sample. Surrogate Compounds that are added to every blank, sample, laboratory control spike, laboratory control spike duplicate, matrix spike, and matrix spike duplicate. They are used to evaluate analytical efficiency by measuring recovery. Surrogates include brominated, fluorinated, or isotopically labeled compounds that are not expected to be detected in environmental samples. Target Compounds Specific compounds that are to be quantified in a sample. Target compound lists are based upon client needs and scope of work. Traceability The ability of an analytical standard material used for instrument calibration purposes to be traced to its source. The standards must be traceable via written documentation to sources which produce or sell verified or certified standards, i.e., National Institute for Standards and Technology, USEPA, or vendors preparing standards from those sources which they have certified. Traceability also applies to the syringes, columns and other analytical equipment. NAL maintains the certifications for all equipment in the corporate headquarters. Trip Blanks A sample, usually pure water prepared in the lab, which is taken to the sampling site and then returned with the collected samples. Later analysis will indicate any false positive results in the real samples arising from contamination during shipment. Water (Reagent, Analyte-Free, or Laboratory Grade) Distilled or de-ionized water or Type II reagent water that is free of contaminants that may interfere with the analytical tests in question. 4 General Requirements 4.1 Impartiality 4.1.1 Laboratory Impartiality Laboratory activities shall be undertaken impartially and are structured and managed so as to safeguard impartiality. 4.1.2 Management Impartiality The laboratory's quality management team shall be committed to impartiality.

To outline procedures for the protection and backup of data/records held on computers. Scope / Field of Application This procedure applies to all quality and technical records. Quality records include audit reports, management review, corrective action requests, and preventive action requests. Technical records include observations, calculations, derived data, calibration records, personnel records, and test reports. Note - Forms are not records until they are completed.* Responsibilities Quality Management Team Members: Specify any alternative retention period Ensure that records specified in the Quality Management System are handled in accordance with the requirements of this document Ensure the unique indexing of records All Personnel: Collect, store, and maintain records for the minimum retention period or the period designated by the Quality Management Team Ensure that records retained are legible Materials Required Entire collection of Quality System Records. Procedure Identification Records are appropriately identified by a descriptive title clearly labeling the record. Collection The personnel/user identified for each record is responsible for collecting the record. Indexing Each record is assigned a unique name, number or alphanumeric identification, and date to distinguish it from other records with the same identification. This index may also be denoted by the IPv4 Address, MAC Address, and Directory Path. Accessing Records are readily accessible to individuals requiring information contained in the record. Records are available to customers for the period agreed to per customer agreements. Subcontractor\u2019s records, as specified by contract, are made available upon request. Filing Filing is considered the location where active records are kept. All records are physically or electronically filed by a method which enhances accessibility and retrieval by a user. If electronic files are used, a backup system or other suitable measures to prevent record loss is implemented. Data may be stored on hard disk drives, flash drives, or network drives. All data storage drives are maintained for a minimum of 7 years after data is reported. Chemistry records are maintained for a minimum of 10 years, and Lead and Copper are maintained for a minimum of 12 years. Complete backups of on-site server files and LIMS are made each morning and evening, and off-site files are kept on two backup drives that rotate in the building weekly for updating. Daily backups of on-site data is retained for a minimum of two weeks. Two backups are maintained on-site, and at least one rotating backup drive is stored off-site to provide resistance to theft, fire, and flood damage. The LIMS production server and the development workstation are serviced by a same day 4 hour response time on-call employee. The software applications are supported by software maintenance contracts from software vendors. Parts of the servers and development workstations are protected by UPS systems to guard against power surges/outages. The hard disk drives are duplexed and mirrored. Retention A record\u2019s \u201cretention\u201d time refers to how long it is kept before it is either discarded, destroyed, or encrypted and compressed for long-term storage. Records are retained on-site for the minimum retention time of 12 years for lead and copper, 10 years for all other chemistry, and 7 years for all other records. Records may be retained longer than the minimum retention time for the convenience of the laboratory. Retention times for work area-specific records are determined by the laboratory and stated in their quality management system documents. Maintenance All records are filed and stored in an office or laboratory environment unless specific media and/or special environmental control is specified to prevent damage, deterioration, or loss.

AOAC 2014.06 (Listeria) 1. APPLICATION OF METHOD 3M Molecular Detection Assay 2- Listeria is used with the 3M Molecular Detection System for the rapid and specific detection of Listeria in enriched food and environmental samples. 2. APPLICABLE MATRICES This method may be used for the rapid and specific detection of Listeria in enriched food and environmental samples. 3. METHOD DETECTION LIMITS The method LOD is defined as the lowest concentration where reliable analytical results can be obtained. This may vary with different species, strains, samples, and methods. For the 3M method, this has been demonstrated to be 1-5 CFU/sample. 4. SCOPE AND APPLICATION This method may be used for the rapid and specific detection of Listeria in enriched food and environmental samples. 5. SUMMARY OF METHOD The 3M Molecular Detection Assays use loop-mediated isothermal amplification to rapidly amplify nucleic acid sequences with high specificity and sensitivity, combined with bioluminescence to detect the amplification. Presumptive positive results are reported in real-time while negative results are displayed after the assay is completed. 6. DEFINITIONS 6.1. Negative Control Test A representative clean matrix that is prepared and analyzed like all other samples in the perspective batch. The negative control test is used to demonstrate that the system is free of contamination and is analyzed for each new lot of reagents. For the MDS, it is a sterile enrichment medium, e.g., Demi-Fraser Broth. Do not use water as a Negative Control. 6.2. Sample A representative portion of any material collected from any source for which determination of contamination level is requested or required. 6.3. Matrix A type of product with intrinsic properties such as composition and process. Differences between matrices may be as simple as the effects caused by differences in their processing or presentation for example, raw vs. pasteurized; fresh vs. dried, etc. 7.

SAMPLE COLLECTION The client or the client\u2019s representative submits samples and a completed Chain of Custody (COC) form to the field laboratory. Once received, the samples are inspected for labeling accuracy and any abnormalities. The sample containers are labeled with the appropriate SDG ID, date and time received and contents, and the samples are refrigerated at 4oC (\u00b12oC) until the time of analysis. 11. PROCEDURE 11.1. Demi-Fraser Broth Preparation 11.1.1. Suspend 55g of Demi-Fraser Broth Base in 1.0 of sterile water. Mix thoroughly. Autoclave for 121\u00b0C for 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Final pH 7.2\u00b10.2 at 25\u00b0C. Add 0.5g Ferric Ammonium Citrate to 1.0 of Demi-Fraser Broth when ready to use. Expires in 4 days after adding. 11.2. Sample Enrichment Foods: 11.2.1. Allow the Demi-Fraser Broth enrichment medium (includes ferric ammonium citrate) to equilibrate to ambient laboratory temperature. 11.2.2. Aseptically combine the enrichment medium and sample according to Table 1. For all meat and highly particulate samples, the use of filter bags is recommended. 11.2.3. Homogenize thoroughly by blending, stomaching, or hand mixing for 2\u00b10.2 minutes. Incubate at 37\u00b11\u00b0C according to Table 1. 11.2.4. For raw dairy products, transfer 0.1 mL of the primary enrichment into 10 mL of Fraser Broth. Incubate at 37\u00b11\u00b0C for 20-24 hours. Environmental samples: Sample collection devices can be a sponge hydrated with a neutralizing solution to inactivate the effects of the sanitizers. 3M recommends the use of a biocide-free cellulose sponge. Neutralizing solution can be Dey-Engley (D/E) Neutralizing Broth of Letheen broth. It is recommended to sanitize the area after sampling. The recommended size of sampling area to verify the presence or absence of the pathogen on the surface is at least 100 cm2. When sampling with a sponge, cover the entire area going in two directions (left to right then up and down). 11.2.5. Allow the Demi-Fraser Broth enrichment medium (includes ferric ammonium citrate) to equilibrate to ambient laboratory temperature. 11.2.6. Aseptically combine the enrichment medium and sample, according to Table 2. 11.2.7. Homogenize thoroughly by blending, stomaching, or hand mixing for 2\u00b10.2 minutes. Incubate at 37\u00b11\u00b0C for 24-30 hours. 11.3. Preparation of the 3M Molecular Detection Speed Loader Tray: 11.3.1. Wet a cloth with a 1-5% (v:v in water) household bleach solution and wipe the 3M Molecular Detection Speed Loader Tray. 11.3.2. Rinse the 3M Molecular Detection Speed Loader Tray with water. 11.3.3. Use a disposable towel to wipe the 3M Molecular Detection Speed Loader Tray dry. 11.3.4. Ensure the 3M Molecular Speed Loader Tray is dry before use. 11.4. Preparation of the 3M Molecular Detection Chill Block Insert: Place the 3M Molecular Detection Chill Block directly on the laboratory bench; (the 3M Molecular Detection Chill Block Tray is not used). Use the chill block at ambient temperature (20-25\u00b0C). 11.5. Preparation of the 3M Molecular Detection Heat Block Insert: 11.5.1. Place the 3M Molecular Detection Heat Block Insert in a dry double heater unit. Turn on the dry block heater unit and set the temperature to allow the 3M Molecular Detection Heat Block Insert to reach and maintain a temperature of 100\u00b11\u00b0C. Depending on the heater unit, allow approximately 30 minutes for the 3M Molecular Detection Heat Block Insert to reach temperature. Using an appropriate, calibrated thermometer, (e.g., a partial immersion thermometer or digital thermocouple thermometer, not a total immersion thermometer) placed in the designated location, verify that the 3M Molecular Detection Heat Block Insert is at 100\u00b11\u00b0C. 11.6. Preparation of the 3M Molecular Detection Instrument 11.6.1. Launch the 3M Molecular Detection Software and log in. 11.6.2. Turn on the 3M Molecular Detection Instrument. 11.6.3. Create or edit a run with data for each sample. Refer to the 3M Molecular Detection System User Manual for details. NOTE: The 3M Molecular Detection Instrument must reach and maintain temperature of 60\u00b0C before inserting the 3M Molecular Detection Speed Loader Tray with reaction tubes. The heating step takes approximately 20 minutes and is indicated by an ORANGE light on the instrument\u2019s status bar. When the instrument is ready to start a run, the status bar will turn GREEN. 11.7. Lysis 11.7.1. Allow the lysis solution (LS) tubes to warm up by setting the rack at room temperature (20-25\u00b0C) overnight (16-18 hours). Alternatives to equilibrate the LS tubes to room temperature are to set the LS tubes on the laboratory bench for at least 2 hours, incubate the LS tubes in a 37\u00b11\u00b0C incubator for 1 hour or place them in a dry double heater for 30 seconds at 100\u00b0C. 11.7.2. Invert the capped tubes to mix. Proceed to next step within 4 hours. 11.7.3. Remove the enrichment broth from the incubator. 11.7.4. One LS tube is required for each sample and the Negative Control (NC) (sterile enrichment medium) sample. 11.7.4.1. LS tube strips can be cut to desired LS tube number. Select the number of individual LS tubes or 8-tube strips needed. Place the LS tubes in an empty rack. 11.7.4.2. To avoid cross-contamination, decap one LS tubes strip at a time and use a new pipette tip for each transfer step. 11.7.4.3. Transfer enriched sample to LS tubes as described below: Transfer each enriched sample into an individual LS tube first. Transfer the NC last. 11.7.4.4. Use the 3M Molecular Detection Cap/Decap Tool-Lysis to decap one LS tube strip-one strip at a time. 11.7.4.5. Discard the LS tube cap-if lysate will be retained for retest, place the caps in a clean container for re-application after lysis. For processing of retained lysate, see Appendix A. 11.7.4.6. Transfer 20 \u00b5L of sample into a LS tube unless otherwise indicated in Protocol Table 2. e.g. Raw dairy products use 10 \u00b5L. 11.7.5. Repeat step 11.6.4.2 until each individual sample has been added to a corresponding LS tube in the strip. 11.7.6. Repeat step 11.6.4.1 to 11.6.4.6 as needed, for the number of samples to be tested. 11.7.7. When all samples have been transferred, transfer 20\u00b5L of NC (sterile enrichment medium, e.g., Demi-Fraser Broth) into a LS tube. Do not use water as a NC. 11.7.8. Verify that the temperature of the 3M Molecular Detection Heat Block Insert is at 100\u00b11\u00b0C. 11.7.9. Place the uncovered rack of LS tubes in the 3M Molecular Detection Heat Block Insert and heat for 15\u00b11 minutes. During heating, the LS solution will change from pink (cool) to yellow (hot). Samples that have not been properly heat treated during the assay lysis step may be considered a potential biohazard and should NOT be inserted into the 3M Molecular Detection Instrument. 11.7.10. Remove the uncovered rack of LS tubes from the heating block and allow to cool in the 3M Molecular Detection Chill Block Insert at least 5 minutes and a maximum of 10 minutes. The 3M Detection Chill Block Insert, used at ambient temperature without the Molecular Detection Chill Block Tray should sit directly on the laboratory bench. When cool, the lysis solution will revert to a pink color. 11.7.11. Remove the rack of LS tubes from the 3M Molecular Detection Chill Block Insert 11.8. Amplification 11.8.1. One Reagent tube is required for each sample and the NC. 11.8.1.1. Reagent tube strips can be cut to desired tube number. Select the number of individual Reagent tubes or 8-tube strips needed. 11.8.1.2. Place Reagent tubes in an empty rack. 11.8.1.3. Avoid disturbing the reagent pellets from the bottom of the tubes. 11.8.2. Select 1 Reagent Control (RC) tube and place in rack. 11.8.3. To avoid cross-contamination, decap one Reagent tube strip at a time and use a new pipette tip for each transfer step. 11.8.4. Transfer lysate to Reagent tubes and RC tube as described below: Transfer each sample lysate into individual Reagent tubes first followed by the NC. Hydrate the RC tube last. 11.8.5. Use the 3M Molecular Detection Cap/Decap Tool-Reagent to decap the Reagent tubes-one Reagent tube strip at a time. Discard cap. 11.8.5.1. Transfer 20 \u00b5L of Sample lysate from the upper \u00bd of the liquid (avoid precipitate) in the LS tube into corresponding Reagent tube. Dispense at an angle to avoid disturbing the pellets. Mix by gently pipetting up and down 5 times. 11.8.5.2. Repeat step 11.7.5.1 until individual sample lysate has been added to a corresponding Reagent tube in the strip. 11.8.5.3. Cover the Reagent tubes with the provided extra caps and use the rounded side of the 3M Molecular Detection Cap/Decap Tool-Reagent to apply pressure in a back and forth motion ensuring that the cap is tightly applied. 11.8.5.4. Repeat step 11.7.5.1 as needed, for the number of samples to be tested. 11.8.5.5. When all sample lysates have been transferred, repeat 11.7.4 to transfer 20 \u00b5L of NC lysate into a Reagent tube. 11.8.5.6. Transfer 20 \u00b5L of NC lysate into a RC tube. Dispense at an angle to avoid disturbing the pellets. Mix by gently pipetting up and down 5 times. 11.8.6. Load capped tubes into a clean and decontaminated 3M Molecular Detection Speed Loader Tray. Close and latch the 3M Molecular Detection Speed Loader Tray lid. 11.8.7. Review and confirm the configured run in the 3M Molecular Detection Software. 11.8.8. Click the Start button in the software and select instrument for use. The selected instrument\u2019s lid automatically opens. 11.8.9. lace the 3M Molecular Detection Speed Loader Tray into the 3M Molecular Detection Instrument and close the lid to start the assay. Results are provided within 75 minutes, although positives may be detected sooner. 11.8.10. After the assay is complete, remove the 3M Detection Speed Loader Tray from the 3M Molecular Detection Instrument and dispose of the tubes by soaking in a 1-5% (v:v in water) household bleach solution for 1 hour and away from the assay preparation area. Notice: To minimize the risk of false positives due to cross-contamination, never open reagent tubes containing amplified DNA. This includes Reagent Control, Reagent, and Matrix Control tubes. Always dispose of sealed reagent tubes by soaking in a 1-5% (v:v in water) household bleach solution for 1 hour and away from the assay preparation area. 11.9. Results and Interpretation An algorithm interprets the light output curve resulting from the detection of the nucleic acid amplification. Results are analyzed automatically by the software and are color-coded based on the result. A Positive or Negative result is determined by analysis of a number of unique curve parameters. Presumptive positive results are reported in real-time while Negative and Inspect results will be displayed after the run is completed. Presumptive positive samples should be confirmed as per the laboratory standard operating procedures or by following the appropriate reference method confirmation, beginning with transfer from the primary enrichment to secondary enrichment broth (if applicable), followed by subsequent plating and confirmation of isolated using appropriate biochemical and serological methods. NOTE: Even a negative sample will not give a zero reading as the system and 3M Molecular Detection Assay 2- Listeria amplification reagents have a \u201cbackground\u201d relative light unit (RLU). In the rare event of any unusual light output, the algorithm labels this as \u201cInspect.\u201d 3M recommends the user to repeat the assay for any Inspect samples. In the result continues to be Inspect, proceed to confirmation testing using FDA BAM. 12. CALCULATIONS Not applicable 13. QUALITY CONTROL 13.1. Reagent Purity Accurate records are maintained, noting date received, opening dates, and shelf life for all reagents, solvents, and standards used in sample preparation and analysis. Any reagent that either contains interfering compounds or becomes contaminated with interfering compounds must be immediately discarded and replaced with an interference-free lot. 13.2. Evaluation of Negative control test Each negative control test must demonstrate that the analytical system and reagents used in the analytical procedure are interference-free. 14. CALIBRATION AND STANDARDIZATION Not applicable 15. DATA ASSESSMENT AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA Data is continually assessed for completeness and accuracy. 16. CORRECTIVE ACTION FOR OUT-OF-CONTROL DATA The following are appropriate corrective actions to be taken in the event of out-of-control (OOC) data in the field. 16.1. Hold Time: Any sample analysis beyond the given hold time needs to be qualified and have it clearly stated in the comment section of the report. Samples that have been incubated for the proper time can be refrigerated for up to 4 days before running. 16.2. Proper temperature: If the incubator falls out of acceptable range 37\u00b0 \u00b1 1\u00b0C then the incubator temperature must be adjusted by small increments until an acceptable temperature is reached. The incubator temperature must be recorded at each adjustment and after a half hour equilibration period. Samples which are influenced by failing temperature must be flagged. 17. SAFETY Safety glasses are required at all times in all laboratories. Protective gloves and lab coats are recommended in the laboratory for all sample preparation. On all projects, chemists need to be aware of and adhere to the New Age/Landmark Health and Safety Plan and any site-specific health and safety requirements. It is strongly recommended that female laboratory staff be informed of the risk to a developing fetus resulting from infection of the mother through exposure to Listeria. Perform pathogen testing in a properly equipped laboratory under the control of trained personnel. Always follow standard laboratory safety practices, including wearing appropriate protective apparel and eye protection while handling reagents and contaminated samples. Avoid contact with the contents of the enrichment media and reagent tubes after amplification. Always wear gloves (to protect the user and prevent introduction of nucleases). 18. POLLUTION PREVENTION AND WASTE MANAGEMENT Always dispose of the contaminated tubes by soaking in a 1-5% (v:v in water) household bleach solution for 1 hour and away from the assay preparation area. Periodically decontaminate laboratory benches and equipment (pipettes, cap/decap tools, etc.) with a 1-5% (v:v in water) household bleach solution or DNA removal solution. 19.

Application of Method 2. Applicable Matrices 3. Instrument Detection Limits 4. Scope and Application 4.1 For reference where this method is approved for use in compliance monitoring program (e.g., Safe Drinking Water Act [SDWA]) consult both the appropriate sections of the Code of Federal Regulation (40 CFR Part 141 \u00a7 141.23) and the latest Federal Register announcements. 4.2 This method provides a specific procedure utilizing axially-viewed plasma atomic emission signals generated only by pneumatic nebulization for the analysis of all analytes. Some AVICP-AES instruments are so configured that the emitted signal can also be viewed alternately or simultaneously in a radial manner. Radially-viewed signals for the determination of drinking water matrix elements (Ca, Mg and Na) and silica are acceptable. The Ca and Mg data can be used in the calculation of hardness. 4.3 When viewing sodium emission from the axial configuration, the ratio of signal intensity to analyte concentration is not a linear response. Therefore, sodium should be calibrated using multiple standard solutions of increasing concentration to properly define the response ratio at various levels of concentration (see Sect. 14.3). 4.4 For drinking water compliance monitoring, a \u201ctotal\u201d element determination (dissolved + suspended fractions) is required. When the measured turbidity on an acid preserved sample is < 1 NTU, direct analysis, without sample digestion, is permitted with the use of some approved spectro-chemical methods. However, when using this method, all samples are digested and pre-concentrated prior to analysis using the total recoverable digestion described in Section 12.16. Pre-concentrating the sample prior to analysis increases analytical sensitivity for meeting the method detection limit (MDL) requirements.Thus, when using this method, the need to measure sample turbidity prior to metal analysis is eliminated. 4.5 Operative matrix effects can occur from elevated dissolved solids. Using this technique, matrix effects have been observed when the concentration of calcium and/or the combined concentrations of the matrix elements (Ca, Mg, and Na) and silica exceed 125 mg/L and 250 mg/L, respectively. To verify that a matrix effect is not operative, an LFM (see Sect. 5.10) must be analyzed when a primary contaminant (see Sect. 4.0) concentration exceeds 80% of the established maximum contaminant level (MCL) or action level. If the absence of a matrix interference cannot be verified, the sample must be analyzed by method of standard additions or another approved method. 4.6 When determining lead by this method, levels of silica that exceed 30 mg/L, when pre-concentrated 2X, cause a suppressive effect on lead determinations. For samples containing silica above 30 mg/L and lead concentrations greater than 10 \u00b5g/L, lead must be determined by method of standard additions or by another approved compliance monitoring method. 4.7 When determining boron and silica, only plastic or PTFE labware should be used from time of sample collection to completion of analysis. In this method, glassware is specifically avoided and only the use of metal-free plastic labware is recommended. Borosilicate glass should be avoided to prevent contamination of these analytes. 4.8 The total recoverable sample digestion procedure given in Section 12.16 is suitable for the determination of silver in aqueous samples containing concentrations up to 0.1 mg/L. 4.9 Compliance monitoring data for metal contaminants are normally reported in units of mg/L; however, the data for the total recoverable analytes in this method are noted in units of \u00b5g/L. This difference is done to reduce or eliminate the listing of non-significant zeros. When data are reported for compliance monitoring, the data should be reported in the same units used to express the established MCL and to the appropriate numerical level of significance. 5.

Reagents & Standards Concentrated Hydrochloric Acid Concentrated Nitric Acid (for trace metals analysis) Purchased standard solutions containing: Cu, Pb, Ca, Mg, Na, and Si at 1000 mg/L (primary and secondary sources). These analytes may be purchased individually or in combination with one another or other elements. 7.1 Reagents may contain elemental impurities which might affect analytical data. Only high-purity reagents that conform to the American Chemical Society specifications must be used whenever possible. If the purity of a reagent is in question, analyze it for contamination. All acids used for this method should be of ultrahigh-purity grade or equivalent. Trace metal grade acid may also be used if it can be verified by analysis to be free of contamination. 7.2 Reagent water. All references to reagent water in this SOP refer to ASTM Type II grade water. 7.3 Calibration Standard Solutions. 7.3.1 To determine concentrations of trace metals in drinking water and drinking water supplies using the recommended wavelengths, utilize a multi-point analytical calibration usable to 1000 ug/L. Prepare in a mixture of 2% HNO3 (v/v) and 1% HCl (v/v) a calibration blank and three calibration standards at concentrations of 10, 100, 1000 ug/L, respectively. To create the multi-point calibration, curve-fit the response of the blank and standards and store as a computer file. This calibration is standardized before each period of analysis using the calibration blank and the mixed calibration standard solution containing 100 ug/L. A new multi-point calibration should be prepared weekly. 7.3.2 Ca, Mg, Na, and Si are calibrated using the same multi point calibration utilizing a calibration blank and an additional high std. at 50 mg/L concentration. 7.4 Blanks Four types of blanks are required for this method. The calibration blank (CB) is used in establishing the analytical curve, the laboratory reagent blank (LRB) is used to assess possible contamination from the laboratory procedure, the laboratory fortified blank (LFB) is used to assess routine laboratory performance and a rinse blank (RB) is used to flush the uptake system to reduce memory interferences. 7.4.1 The CB is prepared by diluting 20 mL (1+1) HNO3 and 10 mL (1+1) HCl in a 500-mL PMP volumetric flask to volume with reagent water. Store the prepared blank solution to an acid-cleaned, never-used 500-mL FEP bottle. This bottle should be dedicated for reuse and storage of this solution. 7.4.2 The LRB is prepared by carrying 50 mL of reagent water through the entire analytical procedure. The LRB must contain all the reagents in the same volumes as used in processing the samples. 7.4.3 The LFB is prepared in the same manner as the LRB, and fortified by adding 2.5 mL of the 1 ug/ml fortifying solution to 50 mL of LRB. The LFB must be carried through the entire analytical procedure. The analyte concentrations fortified in the LFB are: 100 \u00b5g/L. 7.4.4 The RB is prepared by acidifying reagent water in an acid-cleaned LDPE bottle to concentrations of 2% (v/v) HNO3 + 2% (v/v) HCl. 7.5 Instrument Performance Check (IPC) Solution The IPC solution is used to verify instrument performance during analysis. It should be prepared by combining method analytes utilizing the same acid mixture (2% HNO3 + 1% HCl) as the calibration standards at a concentration of 100 ug/L. The IPC should be prepared in a PMP (metal-free plastic) volumetric flask to avoid B and SiO2 contamination. Store the IPC solution in a new, acid-cleaned FEP bottle dedicated for reuse and repeated storage of this solution. 8. Interferences 8.1. Spectral Interferences Spectral interferences are caused by background emission from continuous or recombination phenomena, stray light from the line emission of high concentration elements, overlap of a spectral line from another element, or unresolved overlap of molecular band spectra. Except for interference from background emission and possible stray light, which can usually be compensated for by subtracting the background emission adjacent to the analyte wavelength peak, spectral interferences associated with the analysis of drinking water are minimal. However, the absence of inter-element spectral interference should be verified. Criteria for determining an inter-element spectral interference is an apparent positive or negative concentration on the analyte that is outside the 3-sigma control limits of the calibration blank for the analyte. NOTE: When an instrument equipped with a conventional diffraction grating that provides 0.016 nm first order resolution is used with the wavelengths in the noted spectral order and background correction locations given in Table 1, no detectable inter-element spectral interferences occurs between the trace element analytes listed in this method at concentrations < 20 mg/L. Since concentrations of trace elements in drinking water and drinking water supplies are far below the level of 20 mg/L, an inter-element correction routine for trace analytes would be unnecessary for an instrument so configured. NAL utilizes the Thermo Duo ICAP 6300 with specified resolution of 7 pico-meters (0.007 nm) and therefore has twice the resolution require by methodology mitigating the requirement for inter-element correction routine for trace analytes. On the other hand, the concentration of the water matrix elements can be in excess of 100 mg/L. Fortunately, the matrix elements are not spectrally rich and have few prominent lines to cause inter-element spectral interference. Using this method and analyzing single element solutions of 300 mg/L Ca, 200 mg/L Mg, 200 mg/L Na, and 100 mg/L Si, no spectral enhancement of other method analytes were observed, thus not requiring inter-element corrections. However, there are three concerns worth noting: Note: If wavelengths, noted spectral order, and background correction locations different from those listed in Table 1 are used with this method, and/or the optical resolution of the instrument utilized does not provide 0.016 nm first order resolution or better, the absence of inter-element spectral interference must be confirmed by completing spectral scans over the wavelength area and background correction locations to be utilized. The spectral scans should be completed using single element solutions of both trace and water matrix elements of concentrations noted above that will verify nonexistent apparent analyte concentrations. If an inter-element spectral interference is detected, a correction routine that is operative during analysis must be used with daily verification using SIC solutions, to demonstrate that the routine meets the above criteria. 8.2. Physical Interferences Physical interferences are effects associated with the sample nebulization and transport processes. Changes in viscosity and surface tension can cause significant inaccuracies, especially in samples containing high dissolved solids or high acid concentrations. Physical interferences of the types described above have not been evident in the analysis of most drinking waters. However, the use of a peristaltic pump to regulate solution uptake rate and the use of mass flow controllers that provide better control of the argon flow rates, especially for the nebulizer, improve instrument stability and precision. 8.3. Chemical Interferences Chemical interferences include molecular-compound formation, ionization effects, and solute-vaporization effects. In general, chemical interferences are highly dependent on matrix type and the specific element. To counteract ionization and matrix interferences in AVICP-OES, some laboratories routinely use an ionization buffer along with an internal standard added to both standards and samples alike in the sample train using a peristaltic pump and mixing tee. Use of an ionization buffer is permitted with this method provided the addition does not cause an inter-element spectral interference with a method analyte. However, in drinking water analyses the use of an internal standard with pneumatic nebulization is discouraged because it is not necessary and adds additional variance to the determination. The above stated chemical interferences have not been observed using this method for drinking water analyses when the operating conditions and preparations procedures are followed as written. 8.4. Memory Interferences Memory interferences result when analytes in a previous sample contribute to the signals measured in a new sample. Memory effects can result from sample deposition on the uptake tubing to the nebulizer and from the buildup of sample material in the plasma torch and spray chamber. The site where these effects occur is dependent on the element and can be minimized by flushing the system with a rinse blank between samples. The rinse times necessary for a particular element should be estimated prior to analysis. For the water matrix elements this may be achieved by aspirating a single element standard solution corresponding to their LDRs, while for the trace contaminants single element solutions containing 10 mg/L are sufficient. The aspiration time should be the same as a normal sample analysis period, followed by analysis of the rinse blank at designated intervals. The length of time required to reduce analyte signal to within a factor of 10 times the calibration blank should be noted. Until the required rinse time is established, this method requires a rinse period using the rinse blank of at least 30 sec between samples and standards. If a memory interference is suspected, the sample should be re-analyzed after a long rinse period. 9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Storage 9.1. For the determination of trace and water matrix elements in drinking water and drinking water supplies, samples are not filtered, but acidified with (1+1) nitric acid to a pH < 2 (3mL of [1+1] acid per liter of sample or 1mL per 250 mL of sample should be sufficient). Preservation may be done at the time of collection; however, to avoid the hazards of strong acids in the field, transport restrictions and possible contamination, it is recommended that the samples be returned to the laboratory within two weeks of collection and acid preserved upon receipt in the laboratory. Following acidification, the sample should be mixed, held for sixteen hours, and then verified to be pH < 2 just prior to withdrawing an aliquot for sample processing. If for some reason, such as high alkalinity, the sample pH is verified to be > 2, more acid must be added and the sample held for sixteen hours until verified to be pH < 2. If properly preserved, the sample can be held up to 6 months. 10. Labware 10.1. For determination of trace levels of elements, contamination and loss are of prime consideration. Potential contamination sources include improperly cleaned laboratory apparatus and general contamination within the laboratory environment from dust, etc. A clean laboratory work area designated for trace element sample handling should be used. Sample containers can introduce positive and negative errors in the determination of trace elements by (1) contributing contaminants through surface desorption or leaching, and (2) depleting element concentrations through adsorption processes. All reusable labware (polyethylene, polymethylpentene, PTFE, FEP, etc.) and plastic disposable digestion tubes, caps, and watch glasses should be sufficiently clean for the task objectives. Several cleaning procedures can provide clean labware. The procedure recommended for reusable labware includes washing with a detergent solution, rinsing with tap water, and soaking for 4 h or more in a mixture of 5% (v/v) HNO3 and 5% (v/v) HCl, rinsing with reagent water and storing clean. (If digested LRBs indicate random contamination, the plastic disposable digestion tubes, caps, and watch glasses should be cleaned with 2% (v/v) HNO3 and rinsed with reagent water prior to use.) Chromic acid cleaning solutions must be avoided because chromium is an analyte. 10.2. Plastic volumetric labware PMP (polymethylpentene) or equivalent metal free plastic volumetric flasks (50-mL to 500-mL capacities), graduated cylinders (50-mL), and disposable metal-free plastic digestion tubes with caps and watch glass covers. 11. Quality Control 11.1. All analyses performed under this SOP must be conducted in accordance with NEW AGE Laboratory\u2019s Quality System Manual . The minimum requirements of this program consists of an IDOC, and the periodic analysis of LRB, LFB and other laboratory solutions as a continuing check on performance. 11.2. Initial Demonstration of Performance. 11.2.1. The initial demonstration of performance is used to characterize instrument performance (determination of linear dynamic ranges and analysis of quality control samples) and laboratory performance (determination of method detection limits) prior to analyses conducted by this method. 11.2.2. Linear dynamic range (LDR) The upper limit of the LDR must be established for each wavelength used for the analysis of the drinking water matrix analytes: Ca, Mg and silica. It must be determined from a linear calibration prepared using the established instrument operating conditions. 11.2.2.1. Analyze succeedingly higher standard concentrations of the analyte until the observed analytes concentration exceeds 10% below the known concentration of the standard. 11.2.2.2. Document the LDRs and kept on file. 11.2.2.3. Sample analyte concentrations that are greater than 90% of the determined upper LDR limit must be diluted and reanalyzed. 11.2.2.4. The LDRs must be verified as required for certification or whenever, in the judgment of the analyst, a change in analytical performance caused by either a change in instrument hardware or operating conditions would dictate they be re-determined. 11.2.3. Non-linear dynamic range The upper limit of the non-linear calibration used for the determination of Na is the highest standard used to describe the calibration curve. The non-linear calibration must be established using the same instrument operating conditions used for analysis. 11.2.3.1. Sample concentrations that are > 10% above the upper limit for Na must be diluted and reanalyzed. 11.2.3.2. The upper limit must be verified as required for certification or whenever, in the judgment of the analyst, a change in analytical performance caused by either a change in instrument hardware or operating conditions would dictate they be re-determined. 11.2.4. Quality control sample (QCS) When beginning the use of this method, on a quarterly basis, after the receipt of new calibration standard solutions, verify the calibration standards and acceptable instrument performance with the preparation and analysis of a QCS. 11.2.4.1. The determined mean concentrations from 3 analyses of the QCS must be within \u00b1 5% of the stated values to verify the calibration standards. If the calibration standard cannot be verified, performance of the determinative step of the method is unacceptable. The source of the problem must be identified and corrected before either proceeding on with the initial determination of method detection limits or continuing with on-going analyses. 11.2.5. Method detection limit (MDL) MDLs must be established for all wavelengths utilized for trace element determinations in total recoverable digestates. MDLs are determined using reagent water (blank) fortified to a concentration ranging from the instrument detection limit (IDL) to approximately two times the IDL. To determine MDL values, take seven replicate aliquots of the fortified reagent water and process through the entire total recoverable analytical procedure. Perform all calculations defined in the method and report the concentration values in the appropriate units. Calculate the MDL as follows: MDL = (t) x (S) where: t = students' t value for a 99% confidence level and a standard deviation estimate with n-1 degrees of freedom (t = 3.14 for seven replicates). S = standard deviation of the replicate analyses. Note: If the relative standard deviation (RSD) from the analyses of the seven aliquots must be < 10% and neither random nor reagent contamination is operative, the concentration used to determine the analyte MDL may have been inappropriately high for the determination. If so, this could result in the calculation of an unrealistically low MDL. In this case the MDL determination should be repeated using a lower concentration. Determined MDLs for the analytes: As, Be, Cd, Sb, Se and Pb must be < 1/5 their respective MCL or action level. MDLs should be determined annually, when a new operator begins work or whenever, in the judgment of the analyst, a change in analytical performance caused by either a change in instrument hardware or operating conditions would dictate they be re-determined. 11.3. Assessing Laboratory Performance (mandatory) 11.3.1. Laboratory reagent blank (LRB) The laboratory must analyze at least one LRB (Sect. 5.11) with each batch of 20 or fewer samples. LRB data are used to assess contamination from the laboratory environment. LRB values that exceed the MDL indicate laboratory or reagent contamination should be suspected. When LRB values for the trace analytes are above the calculated reporting limit (2.2 times the analyte MDL), fresh aliquots of the samples must be prepared and analyzed again for the affected analytes after the source of contamination has been corrected and acceptable LRB values have been obtained. 11.3.2. Laboratory fortified blank (LFB) The laboratory must analyze at least one LFB (Sect. 5.9) with each batch of samples. Calculate accuracy as percent recovery using the following equation: R = (LFB/S) X 100 where: R = percent recovery. LFB = laboratory fortified blank determined concentration. S = concentration equivalent of analyte added to fortify the LRB solution. If the recovery of any analyte falls outside the required control limits of 90-110%, that analyte is judged to be out of control, and the source of the problem should be identified and resolved before continuing analyses. The laboratory must use LFB analyses data to assess laboratory performance against the appropriate required control limits of 90-110%. When sufficient internal performance data become available (usually a minimum of twenty to thirty analyses), optional control limits can be developed from the mean percent recovery (x) and the standard deviation (S) of the mean percent recovery. These data can be used to establish the upper and lower control limits as follows: UPPER CONTROL LIMIT = x + 3S LOWER CONTROL LIMIT = x - 3S The optional control limits must be equal to or better than the appropriate required control limits. After each five to ten new recovery measurements, new control limits can be calculated using only the most recent twenty to thirty data points. Also, the standard deviation (S) data should be used to establish an on-going precision statement for the level of concentrations included in the LFB. These data must be kept on file and be available for review. 11.3.3. Instrument performance check (IPC) solution The laboratory must initially and periodically verify that the instrument calibration is within required control limits. For all determinations the laboratory must analyze the IPC solution (100 ppb) and a portion of the calibration blank immediately following calibration, after every tenth sample and at the end of the sample run. Analysis of the calibration blank should always be less than the calculated reporting limit (2.2 times the analyte MDL) for the trace elements. Analysis of the IPC solution must verify that the instrument is within \u00b1 5% of calibration. 11.3.4. Spectral interference check (SIC) solution For this method using the listed wavelengths, the specified background locations, and an instrument with first order resolution of 0.016 nm or better, verification of inter element spectral interference is not required. 11.4. Assessing Total Recoverable Analyte Recovery and Data Quality 11.4.1. Sample non-homogeneity and the chemical nature of the sample matrix can affect analyte recovery and the quality of the data. In the analysis of finished drinking water, these aspects are rarely an issue. However, source water for a drinking water supply can have varying turbidity. Taking separate aliquots from the sample for replicate and fortified analyses can, in some cases, assess the effect. Unless otherwise specified by the data user, laboratory or program, the following laboratory fortified matrix (LFM) procedure is required. 11.4.2. The laboratory must add a known amount of each analyte to a minimum of 10% of the routine samples. The LFM aliquot must be a duplicate of the aliquot used for sample analysis and fortified prior to sample preparation. The added analyte concentration must be the same as that used in the laboratory fortified blank (100 ppb). 11.4.3. Calculate the percent recovery for each analyte, corrected for analyte background concentrations greater than the calculated reporting limit measured in the unfortified sample, and compare these values to the designated LFM recovery range of 85-115%. 11.4.4. If the recovery of any analyte falls outside the designated LFM recovery range, and the laboratory performance for that analyte is shown to be in control (Sect. 11.3), the recovery problem encountered with the fortified sample is judged to be matrix related, not system related. If the analyte in question is a primary contaminant (Sect. 4.0), under certain circumstances additional analyses may be required. For a primary contaminant not requiring additional analysis, for a secondary contaminant, or non-regulated analyte, the data user should be informed that the result for that analyte is suspect due to matrix effects. 11.4.5. Certified blind reference materials are analyzed twice annually to provide additional performance data. The analysis of reference samples is a valuable tool for demonstrating the ability to perform the method acceptably. 12. Procedure 12.1. Open argon tank and stem valve.

For compliance monitoring, total recoverable trace elements are reported in the same units used to express the MCL or action level. If there is no established MCL, the trace element is reported in \u00b5g/L. 13.2. For water matrix analytes, multiply the solution analyte concentrations by the dilution factor, 0.5, and report the data with allowance for sample dilution when analyte concentrations exceed 90% or more of the LDR upper limit, and in the case of Na when the analytical range is exceeded. Round the data to the thousandth place and report up to three significant figures. Do not report analyte concentrations below the IDL. 13.3. For total recoverable trace element analytes, multiply solution analyte concentrations by the dilution factor 0.5, round off the data values (\u00b5g/L) to the nearest tenths place and report analyte concentrations up to three significant figures. For drinking water compliance monitoring, do not report analyte concentrations below the IDL. 13.4. The QC data obtained during the analyses provide an indication of the quality of the sample data and should be provided with the sample results. 14. Calibration and Standarization After powering up the instrument allow it to stabilize anywhere from 90-120 minutes. An initial calibration must be performed daily with a minimum of a calibration blank and three calibration points. Prepare the non-zero calibration standards at the following levels: 10, 100, and 1000 ppb. The calibration blank is prepared by acidifying reagent water to the same concentration as the standards and samples. For calibration standards a serial dilution is recommended to reduce the standard deviation between working standards. The initial calibration must be linear and have a correlation coefficient of 0.998 or better. If the correlation of 0.998 cannot be achieved than the extreme upper and lower calibration points may be removed from the curve so long as three non-zero points remain. During the course of an analytical run, the instrument may be \u201cresloped\u201d or recalibrated to correct for instrument drift. The correlation coefficient for the recalibration must also be 0.998 or higher. A recalibration must then be followed immediately by a new analysis of a IPC and RB before any further samples may be analyzed. 15. Data Assessment and Acceptance Criteria See Quality Control Checklist in 20. TABLES, DIAGRAMS, FLOWCHARTS, VALIDATION DATA 16. Safety 16.1. The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method have not been fully established. Each chemical should be regarded as a potential health hazard and exposure to these compounds should be as low as reasonably achievable. A reference file of material data handling sheets is available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Specifically, concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acids are moderately toxic and extremely irritating to skin and mucus membranes. Use these reagents in a fume hood whenever possible and if eye or skin contact occurs, flush with large volumes of water. Always wear safety glasses or a shield for eye protection, protective clothing and observe proper mixing when working with these reagents. 16.2. Acidification of samples should be done in a fume hood. 16.3. The inductively coupled plasma should only be viewed with proper eye protection from the ultraviolet emissions. 16.4.

Interferences"},{"location":"SOPs/Methods/ICP-OES/EPA%20200.5/#81-spectral-interferences","text":"Spectral interferences are caused by background emission from continuous or recombination phenomena, stray light from the line emission of high concentration elements, overlap of a spectral line from another element, or unresolved overlap of molecular band spectra. Except for interference from background emission and possible stray light, which can usually be compensated for by subtracting the background emission adjacent to the analyte wavelength peak, spectral interferences associated with the analysis of drinking water are minimal. However, the absence of inter-element spectral interference should be verified. Criteria for determining an inter-element spectral interference is an apparent positive or negative concentration on the analyte that is outside the 3-sigma control limits of the calibration blank for the analyte. NOTE: When an instrument equipped with a conventional diffraction grating that provides 0.016 nm first order resolution is used with the wavelengths in the noted spectral order and background correction locations given in Table 1, no detectable inter-element spectral interferences occurs between the trace element analytes listed in this method at concentrations < 20 mg/L. Since concentrations of trace elements in drinking water and drinking water supplies are far below the level of 20 mg/L, an inter-element correction routine for trace analytes would be unnecessary for an instrument so configured. NAL utilizes the Thermo Duo ICAP 6300 with specified resolution of 7 pico-meters (0.007 nm) and therefore has twice the resolution require by methodology mitigating the requirement for inter-element correction routine for trace analytes. On the other hand, the concentration of the water matrix elements can be in excess of 100 mg/L. Fortunately, the matrix elements are not spectrally rich and have few prominent lines to cause inter-element spectral interference. Using this method and analyzing single element solutions of 300 mg/L Ca, 200 mg/L Mg, 200 mg/L Na, and 100 mg/L Si, no spectral enhancement of other method analytes were observed, thus not requiring inter-element corrections. However, there are three concerns worth noting: Note: If wavelengths, noted spectral order, and background correction locations different from those listed in Table 1 are used with this method, and/or the optical resolution of the instrument utilized does not provide 0.016 nm first order resolution or better, the absence of inter-element spectral interference must be confirmed by completing spectral scans over the wavelength area and background correction locations to be utilized. The spectral scans should be completed using single element solutions of both trace and water matrix elements of concentrations noted above that will verify nonexistent apparent analyte concentrations. If an inter-element spectral interference is detected, a correction routine that is operative during analysis must be used with daily verification using SIC solutions, to demonstrate that the routine meets the above criteria.","title":"8.1.

Changes in viscosity and surface tension can cause significant inaccuracies, especially in samples containing high dissolved solids or high acid concentrations. Physical interferences of the types described above have not been evident in the analysis of most drinking waters. However, the use of a peristaltic pump to regulate solution uptake rate and the use of mass flow controllers that provide better control of the argon flow rates, especially for the nebulizer, improve instrument stability and precision.","title":"8.2. Physical Interferences"},{"location":"SOPs/Methods/ICP-OES/EPA%20200.5/#83-chemical-interferences","text":"Chemical interferences include molecular-compound formation, ionization effects, and solute-vaporization effects. In general, chemical interferences are highly dependent on matrix type and the specific element. To counteract ionization and matrix interferences in AVICP-OES, some laboratories routinely use an ionization buffer along with an internal standard added to both standards and samples alike in the sample train using a peristaltic pump and mixing tee. Use of an ionization buffer is permitted with this method provided the addition does not cause an inter-element spectral interference with a method analyte. However, in drinking water analyses the use of an internal standard with pneumatic nebulization is discouraged because it is not necessary and adds additional variance to the determination. The above stated chemical interferences have not been observed using this method for drinking water analyses when the operating conditions and preparations procedures are followed as written.","title":"8.3. Chemical Interferences"},{"location":"SOPs/Methods/ICP-OES/EPA%20200.5/#84-memory-interferences","text":"Memory interferences result when analytes in a previous sample contribute to the signals measured in a new sample. Memory effects can result from sample deposition on the uptake tubing to the nebulizer and from the buildup of sample material in the plasma torch and spray chamber. The site where these effects occur is dependent on the element and can be minimized by flushing the system with a rinse blank between samples. The rinse times necessary for a particular element should be estimated prior to analysis. For the water matrix elements this may be achieved by aspirating a single element standard solution corresponding to their LDRs, while for the trace contaminants single element solutions containing 10 mg/L are sufficient. The aspiration time should be the same as a normal sample analysis period, followed by analysis of the rinse blank at designated intervals. The length of time required to reduce analyte signal to within a factor of 10 times the calibration blank should be noted. Until the required rinse time is established, this method requires a rinse period using the rinse blank of at least 30 sec between samples and standards.

To determine MDL values, take seven replicate aliquots of the fortified reagent water and process through the entire total recoverable analytical procedure. Perform all calculations defined in the method and report the concentration values in the appropriate units. Calculate the MDL as follows: MDL = (t) x (S) where: t = students' t value for a 99% confidence level and a standard deviation estimate with n-1 degrees of freedom (t = 3.14 for seven replicates). S = standard deviation of the replicate analyses. Note: If the relative standard deviation (RSD) from the analyses of the seven aliquots must be < 10% and neither random nor reagent contamination is operative, the concentration used to determine the analyte MDL may have been inappropriately high for the determination. If so, this could result in the calculation of an unrealistically low MDL. In this case the MDL determination should be repeated using a lower concentration. Determined MDLs for the analytes: As, Be, Cd, Sb, Se and Pb must be < 1/5 their respective MCL or action level.

Terms and Definitions Access and Credentials The current NALIMS Demo can be accessed by entering http://Demo/ into any URL browser while connected to the NEW AGE South Haven office network. It can also be accessed directly by navigating to http://10.1.10.20:8080 while connected to the network. The starting credentials for all users is: Username - First initial of first name followed by entire last name (same as email and network login). Password - password Clients Client Folder Upon logging in, clicking the Clients button on the navigation panel, or selecting Clients from any breadcrumbs will navigate to an overview screen of all the Clients in the system. On this screen, users can search, filter, overview, and create Clients. Selecting the [+ADD] button will prompt users to create a new client. Selecting either the Client Name or the NAL Account # will navigate users to an overview of the Client's samples with navigation buttons to view, create, and edit various contents of clients. Adding a Client Upon selecting the [+ADD] button on the Client Folder, a form screen will be prompted to fill out the new Client's information. The only required fields are a name and a NAL Account #. The NAL Account # MUST be unique, and the Client will not be accepted otherwise. Grower Clients that have sub accounts can be created here using a NALXX-XXX-XX formatted Account #. At the top of the screen are navigation buttons to modify the Address or Grower Information for the Client. Adding a Client - Address In the NALIMS, address are often captured using a set of Address-related fields. Namely Country, State, District (County), City, and the actual street Address. Currently the Country and District (County) do not appear on NAL Certificate of Analyses, however they can still be filled out if that information is available. There are also a few different types of address (Postal, Physical, and Billing). The Physical Address should be filled out if only 1 address is given. Adding a Client - Grower Information When adding a Client involved in Agriculture, there is often other information related to who is growing the sample and who is paying for the sample. The 'Grower Info' tab can be used to capture this information in a variety of ways. For MBG and TrueBlue growers, their Grower Number can be stored her to be referenced and reported. Consulting and Distributing Clients can also have a list of referenced clients with whom they work with. Client Contact Listing Add Client Contact Add Client Sample Point SDGs There are two ways SDGs can be created. They can be created without a Client which currently has a bug preventing it from re-adding a client . They can also be created for a specific Client which is the correct way to create an SDG in the NALIMS at this time. This also has a bug preventing it from re-adding a client Client SDG Overview To view and create SDGs under a client, first navigate to that client and select the SDG tab at the top of the screen. This will bring up a screen listing all of the SDGs under that specific client. To bring up a form to create the new SDG, select the [+ADD] button. All SDGs To view ALL SDGs regardless of Client, select the SDGs tab from the navigation menu. Currently creating an SDG this way has some odd behavior.

No aspect of employment with us will be influenced in any manner by race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, physical or mental disability, height, weight, marital or veteran status, or any other basis prohibited by statute. These policies are the result of a continued effort on the part of management to assure compliance with all applicable affirmative action legislation. Further, the company reasonably accommodates persons with mental or physical disabilities in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. NAL supports employment practices that are closely monitored to assure that we are reaching out and assisting minorities and women to provide meaningful employment and opportunities for advancement. All personnel actions such as compensation, benefits, transfer, layoffs, returns from layoff, and the NAL-sponsored training and education programs are to be free of unlawful discrimination. While all employees are responsible for developing and implementing existing programs that will advance Equal Employment Opportunity at NAL, it shall be the primary responsibility of NAL corporate officers to monitor such programs. NAL expects all of its employees to conduct themselves with dignity and with respect for fellow employees and others. Harassment of others based on any protected category such as gender, age, race, etc., will not be tolerated. NAL does not condone or allow harassment of others, whether engaged in by managers, fellow employees, or by vendors (other non-employees who conduct business with NAL). Any person who believes he or she has been subjected to harassment should report it immediately to a corporate officer of NAL. Each report will be given serious consideration and investigated thoroughly. Appropriate action, such as discipline up to and including termination, will be taken to eliminate such harassment from the work place. All reports of harassment and subsequent investigations will be handled discretely. 2.3 Probationary Period for New Employees The probationary period for new employees is ninety (90) calendar days from date of hire. During this time, the employee has the opportunity to evaluate NAL, as a place of employment, and NAL, has the opportunity to evaluate the employee. During the probationary period, both the employee and the company have the right to terminate employment without advance notice and without cause. The probationary period involves the evaluation of performance. Upon satisfactory completion of the probationary period, the employee status will be changed to regular. All employees, regardless of classification, status, or length of service, are expected to meet and maintain NAL\u2019s standards for job performance and behavior. The benefits provided as described in this handbook are available to each full-time employee. Part-time or temporary employees are not eligible for these benefits. For each new full-time regular employee most benefits will begin on the ninety-first (91st) day following full-time status. For some benefits (i.e. simple IRA), there are other waiting periods for full-time, regular employees (refer to section 4.0). The accrual of personal leave hours begins on the first day of full-time employment. 2.4 Personnel Records Important events in each employee\u2019s history with NAL will be recorded and kept in the employee\u2019s personnel file. Performance reviews, change of status records, commendations, corrective action warnings, and educational attainment records are examples of records maintained. Personnel files will be kept confidential to the extent consistent with the law. If an employee should want to review his/her file, he/she must contact a corporate officer to schedule an appointment. All employees are responsible for notifying the company of changes in address, telephone number, and/or family status (births, marriage, death, divorce, legal separation, etc.), as income tax status and group insurance may be affected by these changes. This responsibility includes employees on layoff status and leaves of absence. Employees should also advise the company of any degrees or registrations obtained and of membership in any professional or technical organizations. 2.5 Standard Work Hours and Time Sheets The standard work week consists of forty (40) hours between 12:01AM Monday and 12:00AM midnight the following Sunday. The normal work day starts at 8:00 AM and typically ends at 5:00PM, with lunch from 12:00PM noon to 1:00PM. If for any reason a \u201cno work\u201d day is declared, all exempt, full-time employees may receive their normal compensation at management\u2019s discretion. From time to time, schedules may be changed to meet project scheduling or other needs. Under these circumstances, notice will be given as far in advance as possible. An employee\u2019s time sheet is a legal record of the hours he/she is at work. Compensation is based on the time recorded on the employee\u2019s time sheet. Each employee is responsible for the accuracy of his/her time sheet. 2.6 Job Descriptions At NAL, job descriptions are used to aid in staffing, wage and salary administration, and training. However, job descriptions are not contracts and are not fixed company policy; they are only guidelines and can be expected to change from time to time at the company\u2019s discretion. 2.7 Duties Each employee shall devote his/her entire working time, attention, and energies to the business of NAL, and shall assume such further responsibilities and perform such duties as may be assigned to him/her from time to time by the company. Employees shall not engage directly or indirectly in any conflicting business activity requiring personal service, or which otherwise interferes with performance of duties for NAL. 2.8 Duty Not to Divulge Corporate Information Employees owe NAL a duty of confidentiality and loyalty. The employee shall not, at any time during his/her employment, or for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, divulge to any individual or company any matters relating to NAL, or to its clients and customers. 2.9 Ideas, Developments, Patents, Inventions, Etc. NAL can acquire the ownership of the employee\u2019s inventions and patents if: 1) the employee is hired to develop/create inventions and product improvements, 2) the invention is related to the performance of the employee\u2019s job; and/or 3) the invention is made or developed during billable work hours (time recorded on a NAL time sheet); or while using NAL tools or facilities and/or any portion of NAL finances. NOTE: Facilities refers to any property secured, obtained, owned and/or leased by NAL. 2.10 Performance Appraisals Normally, each employee will receive a performance appraisal every twelve (12) months. The performance appraisal allows the company to discuss overall performance and summarize both formal and informal performance discussions held throughout the review period. It will review strengths and also point out ways to improve performance. 2.11 Promotions; Job Posting NAL has a policy of promoting from within, whenever practical, to meet the growth needs of the company. The company will strive to promote the most qualified and experienced individual, based on demonstrated ability, to assume greater responsibility. At the same time, it may be necessary to recruit and hire outside of NAL in order to attract the most qualified individual for a particular opening. Outside recruiting sources are periodically used to fill open positions. 2.12 Payment of Placement Fee and/or Relocation Fees If NAL pays any person, agency, or bureau, a fee for placing the employee with the company and said employment is terminated by the employee within twelve (12) months from his/her date of hire, the employee agrees to reimburse NAL for all charges and fees paid by the company to said person, agency, or bureau. If NAL pays any relocation fees, such as moving costs, temporary lodging, meals, rental, etc. for the employee as a condition of initial employment, and the employment is terminated by the employee, or by NAL, for cause within twelve (12) months of the first day of full-time employment, then the employee agrees to reimburse NAL all said charges and fees paid by NAL. 2.13 Resignation Before deciding to leave NAL, please discuss your concerns with a corporate officer first. It is an important decision, and there might be factors you may not have considered. Of course, if you have an opportunity that is just too good to pass up, we congratulate you and offer our best wishes for your success. When you resign, your continuous service with NAL is ended; if you should ever rejoin NAL, you will start as a new employee of the company. Please advise a corporate officer (in writing) at least two (2) weeks prior to your date of departure (unless stated otherwise in your employee agreement) so that an orderly transition can be made. This process includes turning in NAL property, completing required forms, and obtaining appropriate clearances. 2.14 Exit Interviews In most cases, when an employee leaves NAL, an exit interview will be conducted with a corporate officer on or before the last day of employment. The exit interview documents the reason for separation and solicits constructive feedback to improve NAL. 2.15 Office Temperature Finding an office temperature that all personnel agree is comfortable is difficult due to variances in ceiling height, proximity to a drafty door or window, and differences in office attire. It has been decided that an average temperature of seventy (70) degrees Fahrenheit should provide a comfortable working temperature for most personnel year-round. In an effort to decrease the heat-loss and drafts in the building, curtains and blinds should be closed each evening during the winter months. 2.16 Visitors All non-employees must have a company escort while on the premises. If an employee is expecting a visitor, advance notice should be given to the office staff. 2.17 Issuance of Keys Keys to the NAL facilities shall only be issued to employees by a corporate officer. Each employee shall be responsible for the return of any key issued to them and shall report any key that becomes missing. No employee shall allow a duplicate to be made of any key issued to them or to allow their keys to be used by another person. 2.18 Company Equipment Use of any NAL equipment and materials shall be limited to company purposes. The care and maintenance of company-owned equipment is the responsibility of all employees. Keep the equipment clean and report any damages to a corporate officer. 2.19 Telephone/Voice Mail Use NAL telephones are to be used for business purposes in serving the interests of our clients and in the course of normal company operations. Answer all calls promptly and courteously. On occasion, personal calls may be necessary, but we ask for the cooperation of all employees to limit these calls to emergencies or essential personal business and in keeping them brief. 2.20 Computer Hardware/Software Security NAL equipment, including computer hardware and software, are valuable assets. They must be used for company business only. An employee may not copy or use any software that has been purchased/leased by NAL contrary to the provisions of the contract or without prior approval from a corporate officer. When an employee is on personal leave, business trips or otherwise absent, said employee\u2019s immediate supervisor may access their computer or files to better serve customers and other business needs. Anticipate this need, and do not expect information left on a company computer or within company files to be totally private. \u2003 3.0 WAGE AND SALARY POLICIES 3.1 Wage or Salary Increase Policy Established wage and/or salary levels are reviewed annually, along with the company\u2019s financial status, and are adjusted as necessary. More frequent reviews may occur based on special circumstances determined by management. \u201cSatisfactory\u201d or \u201cAbove Average\u201d reviews are necessary for salary increase consideration. 3.2 Overtime Pay Authorized overtime hours will be paid to non-exempt employees. Authorization must be obtained from a member of management in advance of hours worked. Non-exempt employees will be paid time and one-half for authorized hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in one week. 3.3 Payroll Deductions Various payroll deductions are made during each pay period to comply with federal and state laws pertaining to taxes and insurance. Deductions will be made for the following: \u2022 Federal and State Income Tax Withholding \u2022 Social Security (FICA) \u2022 Other items designated by the employee At the end of each calendar year, each employee will be supplied with their Wage and Tax Statement (W-2) Form. This statement summarizes income and deductions for the year. If you have any questions regarding these deductions, please contact a corporate officer. 3.4 Time Sheets In order for NAL to process payroll and to supply verification of time billed to our mobile laboratory clients, each employee must adhere to the following procedures: 3.4.1 Bi-Monthly Time Cards It is the responsibility of each employee to fill out and turn in to a corporate officer a time card for time worked in that pay period. Time worked will be calculated in increments of no less than one-quarter (1/4) hour when processing payroll. For Mobile Laboratory Services Only: It is the responsibility of each employee working on a mobile laboratory project site to record time worked on-site in the project notes. Time worked shall be recorded in increments of no less than one-quarter (1/4) hour as this is how payroll will be processed. In the event that a project\u2019s duration is longer than a given pay period, the employee on-site shall submit to a corporate officer a total of hours worked on-site (to be calculated from the project notes) at the end of each pay period. If the project duration is shorter than a given pay period, the employee shall copy the recorded hours worked on-site (to be calculated from the project notes) onto his/her time card in the home office. 3.4.2 Holiday Hours Holiday includes all hours not worked due to a holiday observed by NAL (refer to section 4.7). 3.4.3 Personal Leave NAL has a personal leave program for exempt, full-time employees and is accrued on a semi-monthly basis as follows: Year(s) Of Employment Personal Leave Earned/Pay Period Total/Year 1 \u2013 2 0.5 12 3 \u2013 5 0.75 18 6+ 1.0 24 3.5 Profit Sharing Bonus Compensation At the discretion of the company President NAL, will provide bonus compensation to employees as a means of rewarding outstanding corporate performance. The overall company profit & loss statement as per the corporate tax return will determine the bonus compensation each employee will receive, and this practice will happen no more than once per annum. Profit Sharing and/or Bonus is not a promise or guarantee. 3.6 Paydays Employees are paid semi-monthly on the fifteenth (15th) and the last working day of each month. In order to allow sufficient time to process the time sheets and to prepare payroll, there is an approximate two (2) week delay in receiving a paycheck. If a payday occurs on a Saturday or Sunday, payment will take place on the preceding Friday. If a payday occurs on an observed holiday, payment will take place on the first workday preceding the holiday. \u2003 4.0 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND SERVICES NAL strives to provide a competitive package of employee benefit programs for its eligible employees. Complete and official details of insurance and payroll plans are contained in materials which employees receive on their first day of employment. The descriptions in this Employee Handbook are only brief summaries for your general information. Employees should contact a corporate officer for more details. The existence of these employee benefits and plans, in and of themselves, does not signify that an employee will be employed for the requisite time necessary to qualify for these benefits and plans. 4.1 Group Insurance NAL makes available and will pay up to $300.00 per month for the cost of health insurance premiums for full-time employees and their dependent family members. These insurance benefits become effective on the ninety-first (91st) day of full-time employment. For more details and official terms of these plans, refer to the group insurance Schedule of Benefits summary, which each employee will receive approximately thirty (30) days subsequent to employment. 4.2 Social Security All employees are covered by the Federal Social Security Act. A required percentage of the employee\u2019s salary is deducted from each paycheck to pay the employee\u2019s portion of this protection, and NAL matches each deduction dollar for dollar. This federal plan is designed for the individuals\u2019 future security and that of his/her dependents and provides for retirement, disability, death, and survivor/Medicare benefits. 4.3 State Unemployment Insurance This program is funded entirely by employers in this state. The program provides weekly benefits if the employee becomes unemployed through no fault of his/her own or due to circumstances described by law. 4.4 Workers\u2019 Compensation NAL carries insurance to cover the cost of work-incurred injury or illness. Benefits help pay for medical treatment and part of any income lost while recovering. Specific benefits are prescribed by law depending on the circumstances of each case. To be assured of maximum coverage, work-related accidents must be reported immediately to management and a corporate officer. If necessary, NAL will file a timely claim on the employee\u2019s behalf. 4.5 Simple Retirement Plan (IRA) This voluntary plan permits eligible employees to defer a portion of their earnings on a pre-tax basis to a savings plan allowed by Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). In order to become a participant, employees must complete six (6) months of full-time employment with NAL, and must be a minimum age of twenty-one (21). While this plan has important savings and tax advantages, other aspects require careful consideration. Read the special booklet available describing the plan in detail and consult a corporate officer if there are any questions regarding eligibility. 4.6 Personal Leave Time Regular, exempt, full-time employees accrue time toward their individual personal leave allowance (refer to Section 3.5). Personal leave time can be accrued up to a maximum of one hundred sixty (160) hours. Once your personal leave time reaches one hundred sixty (160) hours, all additionally accrued time is void until the banked hours fall below one hundred sixty (160). Personal leave time does roll over to the next calendar year, and therefore unused personal leave time is not paid out to employees at the end of a year. Personal leave time for employees with hire dates prior to January 1st, 2008 is paid upon termination for regular, exempt, full-time employees. At termination a corporate officer will issue appropriate funds. There is no payment of personal leave time at termination/resignation for employees with hire dates after January 1st, 2008. Personal leave must be scheduled and approved by the employee\u2019s immediate supervisor and countersigned by a corporate officer. To ensure that each request is approved and to assure that appropriate staffing can be maintained, the employee must discuss all leave plans in advance with his/her immediate supervisor. Extended leave (multiple day requests) must be scheduled at least one month prior to the requested time. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, employees are discouraged from taking extended leave between April 15th and October 31st. 4.7 Holidays Exempt and non-exempt, full-time employees are eligible for eight (8) paid holidays in each calendar year. For non-exempt employees, a paid holiday does not count as a day worked in calculating overtime for the week. Holidays that are observed by NAL are as follows: Holiday Date Observed New Year\u2019s Day January 1st Good Friday Friday preceding Easter Sunday Memorial Day Last Monday in May Independence Day July 4th Labor Day First Monday in September Thanksgiving Fourth Thursday in November Friday after Thanksgiving Fourth Friday in November Christmas December 25th When a company holiday falls on Sunday, the following Monday will be observed as the holiday. If a holiday falls on Saturday, the preceding Friday will be observed as the holiday. 4.8 Extenuating Personal Time 4.8.1 Bereavement In the event of death in an employees\u2019 immediate family, up to three (3) working days, with pay, may be granted at the discretion of the immediate supervisor or corporate officer, to handle family affairs. \u201cImmediate family\u201d is defined as: current spouse, children, step-children, siblings, parents, current mother-in-law, or current father-in-law. In the event of a death in the employee\u2019s extended family, one (1) working day, with pay, may be granted at the discretion of the immediate supervisor or corporate officer, to handle family affairs. \u201cExtended family\u201d is defined as: grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, or cousin. 4.8.2 Jury Duty So that employees may serve on a jury without loss of earnings, NAL will pay the difference between the amount of the check received for jury service and normal earnings for the period of jury service not to exceed ten (10) days in any calendar year. If the employee is released from court early and have more than one-half (\u00bd) of regularly scheduled hours remaining, the employee must report to work. Please inform management promptly after receiving notification to appear for jury service. 4.9 Unpaid Leaves of Absence Leaves of absence without pay may be granted by law and/or at NAL\u2019s discretion to eligible employees to maintain continuity of service in instances where unusual or unavoidable circumstances require prolonged absence. The determination for granting such a leave of absence shall be based upon the nature of the request. The employee may be required to use accrued unused personal leave time before being granted a leave of absence. Leaves of absence without pay are of the following types: Family and Medical Leave - Eligible employees may be granted up to six (6) months of unpaid leave per year for: newborn or newly adopted children, a serious health condition of a child, spouse, or parent, or a serious health condition of their own. Military Service - For the duration of required service. For details on re-employment rights under the Federal Military Selective Service Act, see a corporate officer. Military Reserve Training - Up to two (2) weeks per year. It is left up to the employee to utilize paid personal leave time during this time period. Personal - Up to thirty (30) days for compelling personal reasons. Approval is at the discretion of NAL, management and is based on department work requirements, performance history, and other factors. Disability - Up to one hundred twenty (120) days for a medical disability. The specific period must be supported by a physician\u2019s statement. While no loss of service credit occurs during an approved leave of absence, there are other factors to consider such as benefit continuation, reinstatement, and approval processes. For that period of time when an employee is on a leave of absence, fringe benefits paid by NAL, shall be suspended after thirty (30) days. The employee may make arrangements with NAL, to make premium payments on health insurance beyond this 30-day period at the employee\u2019s cost. See a corporate officer for these details. It is NAL\u2019s policy to reinstate a person after a leave of absence to the same position held at the time the leave of absence began, when possible. If the position is not available at the end of such leave of absence, the person will have the opportunity to be evaluated by NAL, and to be recommended to fill another position, if one exists, or an opening for which they are qualified. If no position is available, or the person does not qualify for an existing position, the person may be placed on layoff status. If it is determined that an employee has accepted employment elsewhere or the employee fails to return to work after the authorized leave, their employment will be automatically terminated. 4.10 Return to Work If an employee is on a disability or medical disability leave of absence, said employee must return to work when his/her physician or when a NAL-appointed physician determines ability to resume normal duties. NAL requires a physician\u2019s release before reinstatement to the active payroll. If an employee wishes to extend their leave beyond this point, he/she must apply for a personal leave of absence. A physician\u2019s release may also be required when returning to work from other short-term, medically-related absences. The employee\u2019s immediate supervisor will advise him/her of this requirement, which depends on case-by-case circumstances. 4.11 Education Assistance The education assistance program is designed to provide the employee with financial support to pursue specific courses and educational programs which will enhance company skills in current or future work-related areas. Course work must be approved by the company president prior to registration in order to receive reimbursement. Regular, full-time, exempt and non-exempt employees with one or more years of employment may be reimbursed for a portion of tuition costs and enrollment fees for courses taken at a recognized institution at the end of the completed course. If a satisfactory grade (\u201cB\u201d or better) for the course is not earned by the employee, the employee may be required to pay for all costs associated with the completed course. If the employee leaves NAL, or employment is terminated within one (1) year after successful completion of the course and/or payment of professional fees/dues, the employee will be required to reimburse NAL, for all associated costs of the course, fees/dues, etc. 4.12 Professional and Technical Organizations and Training The decision to join a professional or technical organization rests with each individual. It is his/her responsibility to pay initiation fees and dues. NAL may elect to pay all or a portion of initiation dues and fees to professional and/or technical organizations for employees. The payment of wages and associated expenses for an employee attending meetings and/or training will be at the discretion of NAL management and will be handled on an individual basis. Prior approval is necessary. If the employee leaves NAL, or employment is terminated within one (1) year after successful completion of the course and/or payment of professional fees/dues, the employee will be required to reimburse NAL for all associated costs of the course, fees/dues, etc. 4.13 Automatic Bank Deposit NAL mandates direct deposit of your paycheck. Each employee should receive the proper documentation for this enrollment procedure on their first day of employment. 4.14 Expense Allowance In the normal performance of any job with NAL, there may be times when it is necessary to spend money on behalf of NAL. In the event an employee spends his/her own money on behalf of the company, the employee will be reimbursed for these expenditures after approval is received on a completed Expense Record Form within thirty (30) days of the date of the expenditure. Receipts must be included for all reimbursement expenditures. 4.14.1 Per Diem NAL will provide all employees required to be in the field a per diem. In order to qualify for the per diem the project must be more than sixty (60) miles from the company\u2019s home office. Employees will receive full per diem for travel days that are eight (8) hours or more in length, and half (1/2) per diem for travel days greater than four (4) hours and less than eight (8) hours in length. 4.14.2 Long Term Projects Mobile Laboratory Projects that exceed one (1) month in length, and where housing is provided with kitchen facilities (refrigerator, stove, and sink) and laundry facilities, will be exempt from NAL\u2019s standard per diem policy. 4.15 Company Travel Many of the jobs within NAL require travel outside the company\u2019s home office. NAL requires use of company vehicles whenever possible. A valid driver\u2019s license is required in order to operate any company vehicle. The care and maintenance of NAL vehicles is the responsibility of all employees. Please keep the automobiles clean, smoke free, and report any mechanical difficulties to the fleet manager. In the event it is necessary to use a NAL vehicle for personal use (going home, etc.), the employee may be required (based on the circumstances) to repay NAL, or have a payroll deduction authorized for mileage utilized at the rate that is in effect at the time of authorization. If an employee is involved in a traffic accident, report it to the fleet manager and the immediate supervisor as soon as possible, and submit a copy of the police accident report to the fleet manager. Insurance information is maintained in the glove compartment of each vehicle. If cited for a traffic violation unrelated to a mechanical or procedural deficiency of a company-owned vehicle, the employee will be responsible for paying any fines and/or damage/repair costs not covered by corporate insurance associated with the violation. 4.15.1 DOT Regulations for Transporting Mobile Laboratories NAL operates all mobile laboratory units exceeding 10,000 pounds combined gross vehicle weight rating in complete accordance with Federal DOT regulations. Employees transporting laboratory units exceeding 10,000 pounds must be certified by a medical examiner to meet DOT criteria and possess a valid Class \u201cC\u201d chauffeur license. 4.16 Mileage Reimbursement If an employee finds it necessary to utilize a personal vehicle, a reimbursement rate of $0.30 per mile will be charged for all mileage incurred utilizing one\u2019s personal vehicle for work-related uses. The recorded mileage must be noted on an Expense Record Form and submitted with the standard time sheet. 4.17 Corporate Credit Cards NAL corporate credit cards may be issued to those employees who are in the field, or out of the office on business matters. A specified credit limit will be associated with each credit card and must be used for business purposes only. It is the responsibility of each employee to submit all receipts as soon as possible after use to a corporate office for reconciliation. Each employee will be required to sign an Authorization Form that allows NAL to deduct any personal or unauthorized charges (and/or interest from said charges) from the employee\u2019s paycheck if it becomes necessary. It is the responsibility of NAL to inform the employee if such a deduction is necessary. Any misuse of this credit card privilege may result in revocation. 5.0 EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATIONS 5.1 Communication Posting Area A posting area is located in the kitchenette/conference area of the main office. Important company information and official memos will be posted in this area. Postings are to be provided to a corporate officer for approval and posting. Each employee is responsible for regularly reading this information. 5.2 Suggestions Management encourages employees to suggest methods to improve quality and efficiency in NAL Suggestions should be detailed in order that the system or procedure can be adequately evaluated. If confidentiality is requested regarding any suggestions/improvements, NAL will abide by those requests. 5.3 Complaint Handling Procedure Under normal conditions, if an employee has a job-related problem, question, or complaint, it should be discussed with the employee\u2019s immediate supervisor. The simplest, quickest, and most satisfactory solution will often be reached at this level. If the discussion with the employee\u2019s immediate supervisor does not answer the question or resolve the matter, the employee may then present the complaint, in writing, to a corporate officer. When the issue personally involves the immediate supervisor, the employee may choose to bypass that individual and proceed to the next person in authority without fear of reprisal. However, whenever possible, the employee is encouraged to first discuss the issue with his/her supervisor. An employee may seek the advice and guidance of the company\u2019s corporate officer(s) at any time as NAL practices an open-door policy with employees at all levels. 5.4 Dispute, Resolution, and Review NAL believes that in any organization differences in which a company interprets and applies policies are bound to occur. Discussing and settling differences promptly and fairly will make the company more productive and a better place to work for all employees. If an employee does not agree with the manner in which a policy is interpreted or applied, the employee may (in writing) submit the basis for disagreement to his/her immediate supervisor who will acknowledge its receipt and forward it to the president for review and consideration. The results of the president\u2019s review will be communicated to the employee in writing and made a part of the personnel file. An Arbitration Guidance and Procedures document is maintained in the office for review. 5.5 Union-Free Employee Relations NAL strongly believes it is in the interests of the employees, and the company, to remain union-free. Therefore, NAL will do whatever it can, within the law, to inform employees of the benefits (especially competitiveness, flexibility and communication) that a union-free workplace brings. 5.6 Media Relations Much of the information we work with is confidential or sensitive; thus, all contacts with the media must be referred to the President or his designated representative. All papers, articles, speeches, or presentations to non-company persons must be approved by a corporate officer prior to publication or presentation. \u2003 6.0 EMPLOYEE SAFETY AND HEALTH NAL strives to provide safe working conditions for our employees. Safety regulations of the governments within whose jurisdictions we operate are observed. No person will knowingly be allowed or required to work in any unsafe manner. Safety is every employee\u2019s responsibility, and all employees are expected to do everything reasonable and necessary to keep NAL a safe place to work. Standard safety rules are made available through NAL\u2019s Hazard Communication Program, and each employee is responsible to become familiar with them and observe them at all times. 6.1 Fires and Emergencies -- IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, DIAL 911 -- NAL does have an emergency procedure to follow in the event of fire or disaster. Emergency exits, fire extinguishers, eye wash kits, and first-aid kits are located throughout the facility. Emergency exits and areas around fire extinguishers must be kept clear at all times. 6.2 Accidents or Injury No matter how insignificant an on-the-job injury may seem when it occurs, employees should immediately notify their supervisor and/or a corporate officer of accident/injury. Failure to report such incidents or injuries may be cause for a disciplinary action. 6.3 Life-Threatening Illnesses NAL is committed to providing equal opportunity to all employees, including those who have a life-threatening illness (cancer, AIDS, cardio-pulmonary diseases, etc.). We are also committed to providing a safe work environment that meets or exceeds state and federal regulations. Consequently, employees who have a life-threatening illness will be treated like other employees, as long as they meet performance standards, medical, and all other evidence indicates that their condition is not a threat to themselves or others in the workplace. NAL believes all information regarding an employee with a life-threatening illness must remain private and confidential. We ask all employees to treat employees with a life-threatening illness with compassion and understanding. 6.4 Issuance of Safety Equipment NAL will supply laboratory staff standard personal protective equipment as needed. These items will remain the property of NAL. 6.5 Hazard Communication Program A corporate Hazard Communication Program has been designed by NAL to inform employees of policies and procedures that will help us continually strive for a safe and healthy work environment. The Hazard Communication Program details the various regulatory requirements applicable to NAL and is intended to ensure the protection (both on- and off-site) of all NAL personnel. The Hazard Communication Program incorporates and is consistent with state and federal regulations. \u2003 7.0 STANDARDS OF CONDUCT AND CORRECTIVE ACTION Groups of people working together, for any purpose, require certain guidelines pertaining to conduct and relationships. Accordingly, all employees must be aware of their responsibilities to NAL and to their co-workers. NAL strives to take a constructive approach to disciplinary matters ensuring that actions which interfere with company operations or an employee\u2019s job are not continued. NAL reserves the right to search an employee\u2019s personal effects such as tool boxes, desks, lockers, etc., on NAL premises. Any search of personal effects will be conducted by the employee\u2019s supervisor or a corporate officer in addition to a witness. The witness may be another employee, supervisor or corporate officer. Return of company equipment or company distributed materials may be required. Employees are expected to comply with all requests. Non-compliance will result in corrective action up to or including termination. Violations of standards will result in one of the following forms of corrective action: termination, suspension without pay, or written warning. In arriving at a decision for proper action, the following will be considered: \u2022 The seriousness of the infraction \u2022 The past record of the employee \u2022 The circumstances surrounding the matter There is no way to identify every possible violation of standards of conduct. A partial list of infractions which will result in corrective action is as follows: \u2022 Falsifying an employment application, time sheet, personnel file, or other NAL documents or records. \u2022 Using, possessing, distributing, purchasing, or selling a controlled substance(s) while on NAL premises or while engaged in professional services to a client. \u2022 Reporting to and/or performing work for NAL under the influence of a controlled substance(s) or alcohol. \u2022 Unauthorized possession of NAL or other employee property, gambling, weapons or explosives, or violating criminal laws on NAL or client-owned premises. \u2022 Fighting, throwing objects, horseplay, practical jokes, or other disorderly conduct which may endanger the well-being of any person on NAL premises. \u2022 Engaging in acts of dishonesty, fraud, theft, or sabotage. \u2022 Threatening, intimidating, coercing, using abusive language, or interfering with the performance of other employees. \u2022 Insubordination or refusal to comply with instructions or failure to perform reasonable duties which are assigned. \u2022 Damaging or destroying NAL property due to careless acts. \u2022 Conduct which NAL feels reflects adversely on the employee or NAL. \u2022 Performance which, in NAL\u2019s opinion, does not meet the requirements of the position. \u2022 Engaging in such other practices as NAL determines may be inconsistent with the ordinary and reasonable rules of conduct necessary to the welfare of NAL, its employees, or its clients. \u2022 Negligence in observing fire prevention and safety rules. \u2022 Other circumstances for which NAL feels that corrective action is warranted. This list is intended to only be a sampling of the types of activities which may result in disciplinary action. It is not intended to be comprehensive and does not alter the employment-at-will relationship between the employee and NAL. 7.1 Conflict of Interest We expect our employees to conduct business according to the highest ethical standards of conduct. Employees are expected to devote their best efforts to the interests of NAL and the conduct of its affairs. Business dealings that create, or appear to create, a conflict between the interests of NAL and an employee are unacceptable. NAL recognizes the right of employees to engage in activities outside of their employment which are of a private nature and unrelated to our business. However, a policy of full disclosure must be followed to assess and prevent potential conflicts of interest from arising. Contact a corporate officer if you have questions regarding possible conflicts. 7.2 Harassment Every NAL employee has the right to a workplace free from harassment. Harassment of anyone on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, age, sex, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, marital status or other protected categories is prohibited by law and by the policies of this company. Harassment can include such behavior as slurs, demeaning jokes or comments, innuendoes, unwelcome compliments, cartoons, pictures, pranks, gestures, stereotypical comments, derogatory descriptions or other verbal or physical conduct. Behavior is considered harassment when it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment; unreasonably interferes with an individual\u2019s work performance; and/or affects an individual\u2019s workplace opportunities. Sexual harassment occurs when the verbal or physical conduct described above is sexual in nature or gender-based. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other conduct of a sexual nature; making submission to or rejection of such conduct the basis for employment decisions; and/or creating an intimidating, offensive or hostile working environment by such conduct. Any employee who believes that he or she has been the subject of unwelcome harassment from another employee, a supervisor or manager, or from an outside party in the workplace, or who has observed harassment in the workplace, is encouraged to identify the offensive behavior and request that it stop. If you are unable to address the matter directly with the harasser, or if you do and the behavior continues, report the matter directly to your immediate supervisor or another member of the management team. All complaints will be investigated promptly, impartially, and discreetly. Upon completion of the investigation, the appropriate parties will be notified of the findings. If any employee is found by the company to have harassed another employee, appropriate corrective action will be taken. This could range from a disciplinary warning, training or reassignment to suspension or termination. Management will also take prompt remedial action to prevent or stop harassment of employees on the job by vendors, customers or other third parties. No employee will suffer retaliation for reporting in good faith alleged instances of harassment. Employees and management must work together to prevent and stop harassing conduct in the workplace. We trust all employees to act responsibly to maintain a safe workplace, to treat each other with dignity and respect, and to work to maintain a workplace free of discrimination and harassment. 7.3 Attendance Standards Punctuality and regular attendance are essential to the proper operation of any business. These also help the employee to establish a good working reputation and will be considered at his/her annual review. If an employee is unable to report for work for any reason, will arrive late, or must leave early, notification must be made to his/her immediate supervisor before the workday (in the event of absence or tardiness), or as early as possible (to leave early). 7.4 Absence Without Notice To operate our business effectively employees must keep the company informed of his/her status when off work because of illness or accident. Failure to notify the company of status after three (3) days of consecutive absence will be considered a resignation, and the employee will be removed from the payroll effective the last day of attendance. Likewise, employees must call his/her immediate supervisor daily while off work due to short-term illness or accident, or it will be presumed the employee has resigned. The employee will be removed from the payroll. If an employee must leave work for any reason before the end of the day, please inform your immediate supervisor. 7.5 Solicitation and Distribution Soliciting by one employee of another, or collecting from one employee by another, is prohibited while either employee is on work time. Distributing literature and circulating petitions during work time or in work areas at any time is also prohibited. Trespassing, soliciting, or distributing literature by anyone outside NAL is prohibited on NAL\u2019s premises. Solicitation includes email, telephone calls, and handbills. 7.6 Alcohol and Drugs NAL is a drug-free environment and recognizes that alcohol and drug abuse in any work place is a major concern. We believe that by reducing drug and alcohol use the safety, health, and productivity of employees will be improved. The object of NAL\u2019s alcohol and drug policy is to provide a safe and healthy work place for all employees, to comply with federal and state health and safety regulations, and to prevent accidents and/or injuries. The policy prohibits NAL employees or NAL subcontractors from: \u2022 Using, possessing, distributing, purchasing, or selling drugs or alcohol while on NAL premises or while engaged in NAL business. NOTE: An exception may be made regarding alcohol at company-authorized functions. \u2022 Reporting to and/or performing work for NAL under the influence of unauthorized drugs or alcohol. NAL may conduct drug and alcohol testing of an employee under the following circumstances: Pre-Employment Testing - All applicants for employment, at NAL\u2019s discretion, are required to submit to laboratory testing following their acceptance of a contingent job offer and prior to beginning work (drug screen only). Reasonable Suspicion Testing - When responsible officials have reasonable suspicion to believe an employee is in violation of NAL\u2019s drug and alcohol policy. NAL defines a safety sensitive position as one in which the employee can directly influence operations to the extent that an improper action or failure to take appropriate action could result in injury or death of employees or others and/or property or environmental damage and where others may have no opportunity to recognize, intervene, or rectify a mistake before the harm occurs. Violation of the NAL drug and alcohol policy constitutes just cause for termination of the employee. 7.7 Confidentiality During the course of employment with NAL employees will be working with clients, client lists, business systems, future plans, research and development data, and other information that is considered confidential. Maintaining confidentiality is important to the company\u2019s competitive position in the industry and ultimately, to the ability to achieve financial success and provide employment stability. Protect this information by safeguarding it when in use, filing it properly when not in use, and discussing it only with those who have a legitimate business need to know. 7.8 Dress and Personal Appearance All NAL staff are expected to adhere to an internal dress code policy. This policy has been developed in an effort to maintain and project professionalism within the firm to co-workers, to members of our current and potential client base, and within the business community in general. Personal attire not only impacts others\u2019 perceptions, but also affects the individuals\u2019 professional performance. New Age/Landmark dress code requires either corporate logoed shirts or jacket when working on-site, appropriate pants or skirts, appropriate footwear, as well as any required and/or assigned personal protective equipment when in the laboratory. All staff are expected to wear clothing appropriate for planned activities, job responsibilities (adherence to the Chemical Hygiene Plan is a must for employees working in a laboratory), and weather conditions. Sandals, cut-off shorts, sweat pants, and torn or soiled clothing are not acceptable for any staff, whether in the office or in the laboratory. At no time should bandanas or dew rags be worn. Please note that if you choose not to adhere to this dress code policy, you will be asked to leave work and change into appropriate attire using personal time, not company time. 7.9 Smoking For reasons of safety, public relations, and other concerns, smoking is prohibited in NAL laboratory facilities, at job sites, and in all company vehicles (the laboratories and vehicles contain expensive equipment that must be kept as clean and pollutant-free as possible).","title":"Employee Handbook"},{"location":"SOPs/Personnel/Employee%20Handbook/#employee-handbook","text":"A New Age/Landmark, Inc.

No aspect of employment with us will be influenced in any manner by race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, physical or mental disability, height, weight, marital or veteran status, or any other basis prohibited by statute. These policies are the result of a continued effort on the part of management to assure compliance with all applicable affirmative action legislation. Further, the company reasonably accommodates persons with mental or physical disabilities in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. NAL supports employment practices that are closely monitored to assure that we are reaching out and assisting minorities and women to provide meaningful employment and opportunities for advancement. All personnel actions such as compensation, benefits, transfer, layoffs, returns from layoff, and the NAL-sponsored training and education programs are to be free of unlawful discrimination. While all employees are responsible for developing and implementing existing programs that will advance Equal Employment Opportunity at NAL, it shall be the primary responsibility of NAL corporate officers to monitor such programs. NAL expects all of its employees to conduct themselves with dignity and with respect for fellow employees and others. Harassment of others based on any protected category such as gender, age, race, etc., will not be tolerated. NAL does not condone or allow harassment of others, whether engaged in by managers, fellow employees, or by vendors (other non-employees who conduct business with NAL). Any person who believes he or she has been subjected to harassment should report it immediately to a corporate officer of NAL. Each report will be given serious consideration and investigated thoroughly.

The policy prohibits NAL employees or NAL subcontractors from: \u2022 Using, possessing, distributing, purchasing, or selling drugs or alcohol while on NAL premises or while engaged in NAL business. NOTE: An exception may be made regarding alcohol at company-authorized functions. \u2022 Reporting to and/or performing work for NAL under the influence of unauthorized drugs or alcohol. NAL may conduct drug and alcohol testing of an employee under the following circumstances: Pre-Employment Testing - All applicants for employment, at NAL\u2019s discretion, are required to submit to laboratory testing following their acceptance of a contingent job offer and prior to beginning work (drug screen only). Reasonable Suspicion Testing - When responsible officials have reasonable suspicion to believe an employee is in violation of NAL\u2019s drug and alcohol policy. NAL defines a safety sensitive position as one in which the employee can directly influence operations to the extent that an improper action or failure to take appropriate action could result in injury or death of employees or others and/or property or environmental damage and where others may have no opportunity to recognize, intervene, or rectify a mistake before the harm occurs. Violation of the NAL drug and alcohol policy constitutes just cause for termination of the employee.","title":"7.6 Alcohol and Drugs"},{"location":"SOPs/Personnel/Employee%20Handbook/#77-confidentiality","text":"During the course of employment with NAL employees will be working with clients, client lists, business systems, future plans, research and development data, and other information that is considered confidential.

Training and Authorization Related Procedures Pre-Requisites Procedures QSP - Document Control Workstations Other Related Procedures Atom GitHub BASH Windows Ubuntu Purpose and Scope The purpose of this procedure is to explain how to use the version control system Git to track changes to controlled documents. It includes both an explanation on how Git functions as a tool at an abstract level, and also how to actually perform operations using the Git toolset. When exploring how Git works, most of the information involved can actually be found in a .git file located within a repository. Almost all of the information is stored as raw-text, and can be interacted with directly. However, there is also a Git software designed to provide easy tools in manipulating the text. Terms and Definitions A more robust glossary of Git terms can be found on the official Git Website . The following is a condensed list meant for quick-reference. Repository A Repository is a structured set of data typically in a similar folder and file directory format that operating systems use. Version Control System A Version Control System is a software system used to track bitwise changes to files, including the ability to reverse and combine changes. Examples include decentralized systems like Git and centralized systems like SVN. Fork A Fork of a repository is a complete copy of a particular branch with the purpose of modifying the repository differently than the original. Forks are effectively a new project based on a previous project. Clone A Clone of a repository is a complete copy of a repository structure with the purpose of updating or experimenting. Clones are effectively backups or co-located files of projects. Branch A Branch of a repository is a distinct set of changes to repository files. Branches are used to maintained different variants of a repository that exist in every instance of it. Blob A Blob, or 'Binary Large Object' is an object that represents the contents of a file, but without any header information including the file name. Tree A Tree is structure represented in graphical format, but can exist in any logical form. A tree is an undirected graph that contains no cycles. Git utilizes its own tree structure, often referred to as the 'Git Tree' to represents one level of repository information. It contains information about all the blobs within the directory, metadata and file names, and references to other sub-trees. This allows an entire hierarchy of the repository to be constructed with information about every directory being contained within the directory itself. Commit A Commit is an object that represents a set of changes to blobs, and points at one top-level tree that captures the entire repository in one snapshot. It includes information about the author, the time of change, and a log message about the changes. Commits are only made to one branch of one repository at a time. Merge A Merge combined the commits from one branch into another, and removes the original branch. If conflicts between the commits exist, they must be resolved before the merge can complete. Origin An Origin repository is the original or primary repository of a project, and is sometimes labeled as the \"central\" repository. While Git is a decentralized version control system , it can be used similarly to a centralized version control system by regularly updating the original repository with updates from clones . Remote In contrast to the Origin repository , a Remote repository is NOT the central repository of a project. Remote repositories are often clones of the Origin, used to update different parts of the repository in parallel without conflicting changes. However, remote repositories can also be clones of other remote repositories, allowing for sub-divisions of centralization. Push A Push takes the commits from the current branch of the local repository and overwrites a branch on a remote repository. When trying to push to an origin repository, a pull request is used instead. Fetch A Fetch gathers the metadata from a remote repository branch and checks it against a local repository branch. Fetching does not modify any files except the .git files. Pull A Pull completes the actions described in a fetch . Pulling will overwrite local repository files with the changes described in the identical fetch process. Pulls are typically done by remote repositories and pull from either other remote repositories, or from an origin repository. Instead of pushing a change to an origin repository, a Pull Request is made to ask the origin repository to pull from your local repository. This allows the origin to never be accidentally overwritten. Checkout A Checkout updates a local repository with a copy of a branch or tagged commit from a repository. Checkouts are used as the basis for updates and comparisons. Tag A Tag is marker to indicate a notable commit . Tags are typically used to manage stable, authorized, or remarkable updates, and can utilize various alphanumeric sequencing systems. Additional information on the sequencing systems can be found on the official Git website . Rebase A rebase is when the base (root) of a branch is moved from one commit to another. Rebasing can have a wide variety of use cases, from troubleshooting a repository itself to substituting for proper branching and merging. How Git Works Two Trees When looking at just one machine's files (or one repository ), Git can be viewed as 2 trees that are rooted at the same node. One is the directory tree that the operating system helped create, one is the Git tree used to maintain information about branches , blobs , and commits . The Directory Tree Since Git must run on top of Windows or Ubuntu , it can utilize the very familiar directory tree structures that exist in both to manage repositories . Each folder is either the root, or a sub-tree of the root. Links and shortcuts connecting folders (which effectively create cycles in the directory tree) can exist, but must be explicitly removed from the Git tree using a .gitignore file. The Git Tree The above image represents a Git Tree. Each colorful circle represents a individual commit of an entire repository , including the entirety of its Directory Tree. While the Directory Tree helps maintain the folder and file structure itself, it does nothing to preserve information between changes to files; that's where the Git Tree comes in. The Git Tree not only maintains information about changes made to folders and files in the form of tracking Commits to Blobs , but also maintains various versions of each folder and file in the form of Branches . As indicated by the directed black lines, every commit can be traced back to a commit before it, all the way back to the the Origin Commit (the first commit into the Origin ). Because Merging is a forward action, this structure effectively represents a tree structure. Primary Branches A typical Git repository will consist of two primary branches . One for production (authorized) releases which is often labeled master because that is the default, and one for development (unauthorized) updates often shorthanded develop . Changes are generally not made directly to the production branch as they would take immediate effect without being authorized. Instead, a development branch is spun off of the production branch, and commits are made there first. Once they are verified and validated to be production-ready, the development branch is then merged into the production branch, and a tag is typically created (but not required). When working with multiple machines, branches can be merged on a local machine or pushed to a remote repository first depending on which order of operation suits the situation best. However, merging and pushing should be done in two atomic steps, rather than pushing changes of one branch directly into another. This prevents confusion and allows them to be reverted separately should a need arise. Features Sometimes a large number of changes need to all be made before any of them can be pulled into the master branch of the origin. In these instances it often is easier to manage each changed feature as a separate branch all stemming from the development branch, rather than the master branch. By separating features out into their own branches and merging them into the development branch first, we can ensure that all the features work and work together before introducing any of them into the production system. In the event that features need to be re-designed, this prevents unnecessary updates to the production system, and allows for better system and integration testing. Releases and Tags Once our planned features are completed, or when we need to hotfix a broken feature of a production system, it's useful to annotate the commit with a tag . Tagging a release allows us to document major milestones, but it also allows us to easily revert a repository. Suppose we add a bunch of new features to a system, and call the release 1.1 and it works perfectly. Then we add more features and call the release 1.2 . Suppose however, despite being reviewed and tested thoroughly, a feature is still broken and not working as designed. We could branch the repository off, fix the feature, and merge it back in with a 1.2.1 as listed in the image above. However, suppose those fixes will take weeks, and the system is completely broken until then. We could also use the 1.1 tag to revert the repository to the older, stable state while we wait for the 1.2 features to be corrected. For project management clarity, this new tag would ideally still be incremented to 1.2.1 or 1.3 , and the original tag 1.2 would be considered a broken release.

Using the Git GUI While Git is best used from a command-line interface like BASH , a graphical tool does exist for use on Windows Workstations . To download the tool, navigate to the official Git Download Website and select \" Windows \". To use the Git GUI, right-click in or on a directory that you would like to manage. Either click Git GUI Here to use the GUI, or if using BASH select Git BASH Here and use the commands listed above . Once the GUI opens, the page displayed could be one of two things. If the folder that was originally selected is NOT already initialized as a Git Repository, then the following menu will be displayed to prompt the user to open one. Once a repository is selected, or if one was selected to begin with, then the contents of the repository will be scanned and displayed in the following menu format: The areas are as follows: 1 - Current Branch The current branch of the repository being viewed. Additional branches may exist on your local machine, and it's important that commits are made to the correct branch. To create|checkout branches, use the toolbar menu option Branch -> Create|Checkout. 2 - Unstaged Changes When any file or folder that is being tracked by Git is changed, the changed object will appear in this area. These changes will NOT be included in a commit until they are staged. To stage a change, either double click it in the Unstaged Changes section, or select ' Stage Changed ' from the controls in the bottom to stage ALL changes listed. 3 - Staged Changes Listed here are the changes to files and folders that have already been staged. Changes are made on a bitwise difference, not an entire file. What this means is that if a staged file is further modified, the newer changes are listed in the Unstaged Changes section while the changes selected for staging would remain in the Staged Changes section, despite both changes being for the same file. 4 - Line by Line Edits This section will only display when selecting a staged or unstaged object. The details of the changes will be listed here, indicated by lines that were added and lines that were removed. 5 - Simplified Control Panel While a full range of tools can be found on the toolbar at the top of the window, this section provides the tools typically used for reviewing and committing changes to an active repository. Rescan - Refreshes the program with any new changes that may have occurred within the repository. Stage Changes - Stage ALL current Unstaged changes. Sign Off - Signs out of the current Git User. Commit - Commits all staged changes to the current branch of the local repository Push - Pushes the most recent commit of the current branch to a remote repository. Training and Authorization This procedure is the primary training for obtaining competency with Git . Evidence of training can be shown by completing at least the following actions via one of the 4 interfacing tools (Github.com, Atom, BASH, or GitGUI): Initialize a Repository Clone a Repository Fork a Repository Create a Branch Add Commits Push Commits Fetch Commits Pull Commits Merge a Branch Evidence of Supervision and Authorization is shown through an additional commit on the training repositories by either the IT Director or another personnel who is competent in Git.","title":"Standard Operating Procedure - Git"},{"location":"SOPs/Software%20and%20Computers/Git/#standard-operating-procedure-git","text":"Most recently edited by: Paul VanderWeele Most recent edit date: Feb 15, 2022 Edits were authorized by: Paul VanderWeele","title":"Standard Operating Procedure - Git"},{"location":"SOPs/Software%20and%20Computers/Git/#table-of-contents","text":"Related Procedures Purpose and Scope Terms and Definitions How Git Works Using Git on GitHub Using Git with Atom Using Git on BASH Using the Git GUI Training and Authorization","title":"Table of Contents"},{"location":"SOPs/Software%20and%20Computers/Git/#related-procedures","text":"","title":"Related Procedures"},{"location":"SOPs/Software%20and%20Computers/Git/#pre-requisites-procedures","text":"QSP - Document Control Workstations","title":"Pre-Requisites Procedures"},{"location":"SOPs/Software%20and%20Computers/Git/#other-related-procedures","text":"Atom GitHub BASH Windows Ubuntu","title":"Other Related Procedures"},{"location":"SOPs/Software%20and%20Computers/Git/#purpose-and-scope","text":"The purpose of this procedure is to explain how to use the version control system Git to track changes to controlled documents.

The Git Tree not only maintains information about changes made to folders and files in the form of tracking Commits to Blobs , but also maintains various versions of each folder and file in the form of Branches . As indicated by the directed black lines, every commit can be traced back to a commit before it, all the way back to the the Origin Commit (the first commit into the Origin ). Because Merging is a forward action, this structure effectively represents a tree structure.","title":"The Git Tree"},{"location":"SOPs/Software%20and%20Computers/Git/#primary-branches","text":"A typical Git repository will consist of two primary branches . One for production (authorized) releases which is often labeled master because that is the default, and one for development (unauthorized) updates often shorthanded develop . Changes are generally not made directly to the production branch as they would take immediate effect without being authorized. Instead, a development branch is spun off of the production branch, and commits are made there first. Once they are verified and validated to be production-ready, the development branch is then merged into the production branch, and a tag is typically created (but not required). When working with multiple machines, branches can be merged on a local machine or pushed to a remote repository first depending on which order of operation suits the situation best. However, merging and pushing should be done in two atomic steps, rather than pushing changes of one branch directly into another. This prevents confusion and allows them to be reverted separately should a need arise.","title":"Primary Branches"},{"location":"SOPs/Software%20and%20Computers/Git/#features","text":"Sometimes a large number of changes need to all be made before any of them can be pulled into the master branch of the origin. In these instances it often is easier to manage each changed feature as a separate branch all stemming from the development branch, rather than the master branch. By separating features out into their own branches and merging them into the development branch first, we can ensure that all the features work and work together before introducing any of them into the production system. In the event that features need to be re-designed, this prevents unnecessary updates to the production system, and allows for better system and integration testing.","title":"Features"},{"location":"SOPs/Software%20and%20Computers/Git/#releases-and-tags","text":"Once our planned features are completed, or when we need to hotfix a broken feature of a production system, it's useful to annotate the commit with a tag .

Suppose we add a bunch of new features to a system, and call the release 1.1 and it works perfectly. Then we add more features and call the release 1.2 . Suppose however, despite being reviewed and tested thoroughly, a feature is still broken and not working as designed. We could branch the repository off, fix the feature, and merge it back in with a 1.2.1 as listed in the image above. However, suppose those fixes will take weeks, and the system is completely broken until then. We could also use the 1.1 tag to revert the repository to the older, stable state while we wait for the 1.2 features to be corrected. For project management clarity, this new tag would ideally still be incremented to 1.2.1 or 1.3 , and the original tag 1.2 would be considered a broken release.","title":"Releases and Tags"},{"location":"SOPs/Software%20and%20Computers/Git/#using-git-on-githubcom","text":"Follow the GitHub SOP guide.","title":"Using Git on GitHub.com"},{"location":"SOPs/Software%20and%20Computers/Git/#using-git-with-atom","text":"Follow the Atom SOP guide.","title":"Using Git with Atom"},{"location":"SOPs/Software%20and%20Computers/Git/#using-git-on-bash","text":"Below are commands used in BASH to simplify using Git.

Terms and Definitions User A GitHub User is an entity controlled by 1 personnel, and is used to manage, create, and contribute to Repositories on GitHub.com . User actions can be considered uniquely performed by a single personnel, and can therefore be used as a signature for Technical Records . Organization A GitHub Organization is an entity controlled by 1 or more personnel, and is used to organize projects that are contributed to by multiple users. The Organization for NAL is [NEWAGE-Labs](https://github.com/NEWAGE-Labs, and is a major component of the NAL Document Control System . Web Application A Web Application is a software program that runs on a computer open to internet traffic. Users connect to the web application via a web browser , via http/ssh on BASH , or (in the case of GitHub) via the Atom text editor. Pull Request A Pull Request is a GitHub-specific operation to help organize discussions around a particular set of commits BEFORE the commits are merged into the primary branch. This is the primary feature of using GitHub rather than simply using a local Git repository. Sometimes a pull request is for one user to git-pull a branch from one repository to another, but it is often used inside a single repository to add commentary on a feature update before it is merged. Pull Requests have a Open/Closed state that can be toggled, and can also reference Issues . Merge A Merge on GitHub is slightly different than a raw git-merge , but uses the same machinery underneath. A GitHub Merge is an operation on a Pull Request that merges all staged commits in the request. A Merge can contain additional commentary about issues and corrective actions relating to software release process itself, or relevant hotfixes following the merge. Repository A Repository on GitHub is essentially the same as a repo in Git , but is formatted to functionally interact with the rest of the GitHub application. Commit A Commit on GitHub is essentially the same as a commit in Git , but is formatted to functionally interact with the rest of the GitHub application. Author An Author on GitHub is a User who is specifically responsible for the upload or editing of a commit or Pull Request . Reviewer A Reviewer on GitHub is a User who is requested for reviewing commit changes in a Pull Request . Assignee An assignee on GitHub is a User who is assigned to a particular Issue or Pull Request . Project A Project is an entity on GitHub that is a collection of Tasks for either a specific Organization , or a specific Repository . Task A Task in an entity on GitHub inside of a Project . Tasks are often are linked 1-to-1 with Issues to create project management structure across various Repositories . Issue An issue is an entity on GitHub, typically pertaining to a proposed change or current problem with a Repository or to an Organization . Issues are often linked 1-to-1 inside of a Project with Tasks , and can be expanded by linking additional entities like Authors , Reviewers , Assigness , Pull Requests , Milestones , and Labels . Issues are the primary place of recorded conversation and collaboration on GitHub for both NAL software development and NAL quality management document control. Issues are part of the NAL Technical Records . Milestone A Milestone is an entity on GitHub that denotes deadline for a collection of Issues . Milestones can be used to help organize Projects around important deadlines and company goals. Label A Label is an entity on GitHub that can be applied to Issues to help index and organize them. Multiple Labels can be used to create sub-lists and to aid in documentation. Training and Authorization The Hello World Quickstart Guide is the primary part of training for NEW AGE personnel who utilize GitHub, and completion of it is sufficient to obtain competency to contribute to repositories in the organization. Alternative repository work can be used as evidence for competency to contribute to repositories if it contains each component of the branch-commit-pull-merge process. Publishing of documents to the NAL Organization's GitHub Pages sites is considered a separate training, and sufficient evidence of competency can be attained by completing the Quickstart and Getting Started guides on the GitHub Pages Documentation site, or by showing evidence of competency for MkDocs . Personnel must successfully complete all guides (or other sufficient work) on the GitHub account that is marked as a contributor to the NEWAGE-Labs GitHub Organization . The supervisor(s) for the training is the User marked as Owner of the NAL organization.

Markdown Most recently edited by: Paul VanderWeele Most recent edit date: Jan 19th, 2021 Edits were authorized by: Table of Content Purpose and Scope Terms and Definitions Usage Syntax Guide Purpose and Scope The purpose of this procedure is to demonstrate how to use the Markdown syntax to enrich text to include bolding, italicizing, headers, tables, hyperlinks, and other formatting features without the bulk and complexity of a XML-style document like Office 365's Word Processor . Markdown is used to format the documentation on the NAL Documentation Server . Terms and Definitions Raw Text Raw Text is computer encoded bits that correspond with human readable characters only. These characters can be from any language, and can represent numerals, punctuation, or whitespace. Raw Text File A Raw Text File is a indexed file on an operating system consisting of only raw text like a .txt, .csv, or .md file. This excludes XML-based documents like Microsoft Word's .Doc and .Docx formats. Local IP Address A Local IP Address is a number correlated by the office router to correspond with the MAC Address of a computer on the local network. Usage Adding Markdown Adding Markdown syntax to text is very straight-forward as the formatting is text itself. Markdown is kept as raw text in files with a .md extension indicating it is a Markdown file. Markdown files can be created or edited in almost any raw text editor like Notepad or Atom , and should contain ONLY Markdown content. From Markdown to HTML. However, without another program, the text does not actually look formatted. An extension exists for Atom that allows it to display formatted Markdown within the editor; however this is primarily useful only for personnel that are editing documents. The published and controlled version of the document is rendered using an interpreting program. We use the interpretter MkDocs to convert the Markdown syntax into HTML . The formatting web documents are then served on the NAL Documentation Server's local IP address using NGINX . Version Control Because Markdown files are raw text , every bit of information can be broken down into rows and columns. We use the version control system Git to keep track of each change made to Markdown files including exactly which rows and columns were edited, what changes were made, who changed them, what date/time changes were commited , and notes about each change.

Additional backticks may be used. This allows ``` to be typed within the code block. Optionally, a language can be specified on the first line.
