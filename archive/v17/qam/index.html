<blockquote>
<p>A blank is an artificial sample designed to monitor the introduction of artifacts into the process. For aqueous samples, reagent water is used as a blank matrix; however, a universal blank matrix does not exist for solid samples, and therefore, no matrix is used. There are several types of blanks, which monitor a variety of processes: - A method blank is taken through sample preparation and analysis only. It is a test for contamination in the laboratory procedure. – A storage blank is stored and analyzed with samples at the laboratory. It is a test for contamination in sample storage as well as sample preparation and analysis. – A trip blank is shipped to and from the field with the sample containers. It is not opened in the field and, therefore, provides a test for contamination from sample preservation, site conditions, and transport as well as sample storage, preparation, and analysis. It is most commonly used for volatile organics. – A field blank is opened in the field and tests for contamination from the atmosphere as well as those activities listed under trip blank.</p>

<p>Management and personnel are to be free from any undue internal and external commercial, financial, and other pressures that may adversely affect the quality of their work. The integrity of test results is the responsibility of all personnel. Management ensures that employees are never instructed or forced to alter or falsify data.</p>
<h6 id="details">Details:</h6>
<p>The following list provides some guidelines on how employees avoid conflict of interest situations.
Employees shall not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Falsify records, prepare fraudulent reports, or make false claims.</li>
<li>Seek or use privileged or confidential company information, or data from any customer, for any purpose beyond the scope of employment.</li>
<li>Conduct non-laboratory business on laboratory time, or use company facilities or equipment to conduct outside interests in business, unless prior approval has been obtained.</li>
<li>Solicit business on their own behalf (and not the laboratory) from a customer.</li>
<li>Be employed by, or affiliated with, organizations whose products or services compete with laboratory products or services.</li>
<li>Have employment that negatively affects or interferes with their performance of laboratory duties.</li>
<li>Compete with the laboratory in the purchase, sale, or leasing of property or goods.</li>
<li>Allow association, family, or friends to influence business decisions to their benefit - decisions must be made on a strictly business basis, always in the best interest of the laboratory.</li>
<li>Make any decision that provides gains or benefits to the employee and/or others at the expense of the laboratory or its integrity.</li>
<li>Have personal financial dealings with an individual or company that does business with the laboratory which might influence decisions made on the laboratory’s behalf at the expense of the laboratory or its integrity.</li>

<h4 id="651-establishing-and-maintaining-metrological-traceability">6.5.1 Establishing and Maintaining Metrological Traceability</h4>
<p>The program for calibration of equipment demands that calibrations and measurements made by the laboratory are traceable to the International System of Units.</p>
<p>Calibration laboratories providing services to the laboratory are to provide evidence of measurement traceability of its own measurement standards and measuring instrument to the SI. This is done by means of an unbroken chain of calibration or comparisons linking them to primary standards of the SI units of measurement. Such primary standards are those used by national measurement standards.  </p>
<p>Calibration certificates issued by calibration laboratories are to include the measurement results, including the measurement uncertainty and a statement of conformance with an identified metrological specification.</p>
<h4 id="652-ensuring-measurement-results-are-traceable">6.5.2 Ensuring Measurement Results are Traceable</h4>
<h6 id="a_3">(a)</h6>
<p>Calibration laboratories providing services to the laboratory are to provide documentation demonstrating measurement capability and competence to perform the calibration services requested by the laboratory.</p>
<h6 id="b_3">(b)</h6>
<p>A reference material is a homogeneous and well characterized substance used for standardization of equipment used in the testing process. Reference materials are traceable to national or international standard reference materials (SRMs), such as National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), or certified reference materials (CRMs) from competent suppliers of reference materials.</p>
<p>The measurement integrity of internal reference materials generated by the laboratory is evaluated against either standard reference materials or certified reference materials from an independent source when it is technically and economically possible.</p>
<h6 id="c_2">(c)</h6>
<p>The measurement traceability to SI units may be achieved by measurements related to national measurement standards. National measurement standards may be used as primary standards that are primary realizations of the SI units or agreed representations of SI units. National measurement standards based on fundamental physical constants, or standards calibrated by another national metrological institute may be use as primary standards.</p>
