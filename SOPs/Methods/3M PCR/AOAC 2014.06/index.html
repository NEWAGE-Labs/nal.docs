<h1 id="1-application-of-method">1. APPLICATION OF METHOD</h1>
<p>3M Molecular Detection Assay 2- Listeria is used with the 3M Molecular Detection System for the rapid and specific detection of Listeria in enriched food and environmental samples.</p>
<h1 id="2-applicable-matrices">2. APPLICABLE MATRICES</h1>
<p>This method may be used for the rapid and specific detection of Listeria in enriched food and environmental samples.  </p>
<h1 id="3-method-detection-limits">3.    METHOD DETECTION LIMITS</h1>
<p>The method LOD is defined as the lowest concentration where reliable analytical results can be obtained. This may vary with different species, strains, samples, and methods. For the 3M method, this has been demonstrated to be 1-5 CFU/sample.</p>
<h1 id="4-scope-and-application">4.    SCOPE AND APPLICATION</h1>
<p>This method may be used for the rapid and specific detection of Listeria in enriched food and environmental samples.</p>
<h1 id="5-summary-of-method">5.    SUMMARY OF METHOD</h1>
<p>The 3M Molecular Detection Assays use loop-mediated isothermal amplification to rapidly amplify nucleic acid sequences with high specificity and sensitivity, combined with bioluminescence to detect the amplification. Presumptive positive results are reported in real-time while negative results are displayed after the assay is completed.</p>
<h1 id="6-definitions">6.    DEFINITIONS</h1>
<h2 id="61-negative-control-test">6.1. Negative Control Test</h2>
<p>A representative clean matrix that is prepared and analyzed like all other samples in the perspective batch. The negative control test is used to demonstrate that the system is free of contamination and is analyzed for each new lot of reagents. For the MDS, it is a sterile enrichment medium, e.g., Demi-Fraser Broth. Do not use water as a Negative Control.</p>
<h2 id="62-sample">6.2. Sample</h2>
<p>A representative portion of any material collected from any source for which determination of contamination level is requested or required.</p>
<h2 id="63-matrix">6.3. Matrix</h2>
<p>A type of product with intrinsic properties such as composition and process. Differences between matrices may be as simple as the effects caused by differences in their processing or presentation for example, raw vs. pasteurized; fresh vs. dried, etc.</p>

<p>After the assay is complete, remove the 3M Detection Speed Loader Tray from the 3M Molecular Detection Instrument and dispose of the tubes by soaking in a 1-5% (v:v in water) household bleach solution for 1 hour and away from the assay preparation area.</p>
<p>Notice: To minimize the risk of false positives due to cross-contamination, never open reagent tubes containing amplified DNA. This includes Reagent Control, Reagent, and Matrix Control tubes. Always dispose of sealed reagent tubes by soaking in a 1-5% (v:v in water) household bleach solution for 1 hour and away from the assay preparation area.</p>
<h2 id="119-results-and-interpretation">11.9.    Results and Interpretation</h2>
<p>An algorithm interprets the light output curve resulting from the detection of the nucleic acid amplification. Results are analyzed automatically by the software and are color-coded based on the result. A Positive or Negative result is determined by analysis of a number of unique curve parameters. Presumptive positive results are reported in real-time while Negative and Inspect results will be displayed after the run is completed.</p>
<p>Presumptive positive samples should be confirmed as per the laboratory standard operating procedures or by following the appropriate reference method confirmation, beginning with transfer from the primary enrichment to secondary enrichment broth (if applicable), followed by subsequent plating and confirmation of isolated using appropriate biochemical and serological methods.</p>
<p>NOTE: Even a negative sample will not give a zero reading as the system and 3M Molecular Detection Assay 2- Listeria amplification reagents have a “background” relative light unit (RLU).</p>
<p>In the rare event of any unusual light output, the algorithm labels this as “Inspect.” 3M recommends the user to repeat the assay for any Inspect samples. In the result continues to be Inspect, proceed to confirmation testing using FDA BAM.</p>

<h2 id="132-evaluation-of-negative-control-test">13.2.    Evaluation of Negative control test</h2>
<p>Each negative control test must demonstrate that the analytical system and reagents used in the analytical procedure are interference-free.</p>

<h1 id="16-corrective-action-for-out-of-control-data">16. CORRECTIVE ACTION FOR OUT-OF-CONTROL DATA</h1>
<p>The following are appropriate corrective actions to be taken in the event of out-of-control (OOC) data in the field.
16.1.   Hold Time:  Any sample analysis beyond the given hold time needs to be qualified and have it clearly stated in the comment section of the report. Samples that have been incubated for the proper time can be refrigerated for up to 4 days before running.</p>
<p>16.2.   Proper temperature: If the incubator falls out of acceptable range 37° ± 1°C then the incubator temperature must be adjusted by small increments until an acceptable temperature is reached. The incubator temperature must be recorded at each adjustment and after a half hour equilibration period. Samples which are influenced by failing temperature must be flagged.</p>
<h1 id="17-safety">17. SAFETY</h1>
<p>Safety glasses are required at all times in all laboratories. Protective gloves and lab coats are recommended in the laboratory for all sample preparation. On all projects, chemists need to be  aware of and adhere to the New Age/Landmark Health and Safety Plan and any site-specific health and safety requirements.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that female laboratory staff be informed of the risk to a developing fetus resulting from infection of the mother through exposure to Listeria.</p>
<p>Perform pathogen testing in a properly equipped laboratory under the control of trained personnel.</p>
<p>Always follow standard laboratory safety practices, including wearing appropriate protective apparel and eye protection while handling reagents and contaminated samples.</p>
<p>Avoid contact with the contents of the enrichment media and reagent tubes after amplification.</p>
<p>Always wear gloves (to protect the user and prevent introduction of nucleases).</p>
<h1 id="18-pollution-prevention-and-waste-management">18. POLLUTION PREVENTION AND WASTE MANAGEMENT</h1>
<p>Always dispose of the contaminated tubes by soaking in a 1-5% (v:v in water) household bleach solution for 1 hour and away from the assay preparation area.</p>
<p>Periodically decontaminate laboratory benches and equipment (pipettes, cap/decap tools, etc.) with a 1-5% (v:v in water) household bleach solution or DNA removal solution.</p>
