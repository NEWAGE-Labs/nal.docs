ANALYSIS of E. coli
BY AOAC 2017.01</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>APPLICATION OF METHOD
3M Molecular Detection Assay 2- E. coli O157:H7 (including H7) is used with the 3M Molecular Detection System for the rapid and specific detection of E. coli O157:H7 (including H7) in enriched food, feed and food process environmental samples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>APPLICABLE MATRICES
This method may be used for the rapid and specific detection of E. coli O157:H7 in enriched food, feed, and food process environmental samples.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>METHOD DETECTION LIMITS
The method LOD is defined as the lowest concentration where reliable analytical results can be obtained. This may vary with different species, strains, samples, and methods. For the 3M method, this has been demonstrated to be 1-5 CFU/sample.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SCOPE AND APPLICATION
This method may be used for the rapid and specific detection of E. coli O157:H7 in enriched food and environmental samples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SUMMARY OF METHOD
The 3M Molecular Detection Assays use loop-mediated isothermal amplification to rapidly amplify nucleic acid sequences with high specificity and sensitivity, combined with bioluminescence to detect the amplification. Presumptive positive results are reported in real-time while negative results are displayed after the assay is completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DEFINITIONS
6.1.    Negative control test: A representative clean matrix that is prepared and analyzed like all other samples in the perspective batch. The negative control test is used to demonstrate that the system is free of contamination and is analyzed for each new lot of reagents. For the MDS, it is a sterile enrichment medium, e.g., Buffered Peptone Water (BPW). Do not use water as a Negative Control.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>6.2.    Sample: A representative portion of any material collected from any source for which determination of contamination level is requested or required.</p>
<p>6.3.    Matrix: A type of product with intrinsic properties such as composition and process. Differences between matrices may be as simple as the effects caused by differences in their processing or presentation for example, raw vs. pasteurized; fresh vs. dried, etc.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>PROCEDURE<br />
11.1.   Sample Enrichment
 Foods:
11.1.1. Pre-warm BPW ISO enrichment medium to 41.5±1°C depending upon matrices tested. See Table 2.
11.1.2. Aseptically combine the enrichment medium and sample. For all meat and highly particulate samples, the use of filter bags is recommended.
11.1.3. Homogenize all matrices except leafy produce and fruit thoroughly by blending, stomaching, or hand mixing for 2±0.2 minutes. Incubate as outlined in the appropriate  protocol table (See Table 2)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>11.2.   Preparation of the 3M Molecular Detection Speed Loader Tray:
11.2.1. Wet a cloth with a 1-5% (v:v in water) household bleach solution and wipe the 3M Molecular Detection Speed Loader Tray.
11.2.2. Rinse the 3M Molecular Detection Speed Loader Tray with water.
11.2.3. Use a disposable towel to wipe the 3M Molecular Detection Speed Loader Tray dry.
11.2.4. Ensure the 3M Molecular Speed Loader Tray is dry before use.</p>
<p>11.3.   Preparation of the 3M Molecular Detection Chill Block Insert:
Place the 3M Molecular Detection Chill Block directly on the laboratory bench; (the 3M Molecular Detection Chill Block Tray is not used). Use the chill block at ambient temperature (20-25°C).</p>
<p>11.4.   Preparation of the 3M Molecular Detection Heat Block Insert:
11.4.1. Place the 3M Molecular Detection Heat Block Insert in a dry double heater unit. Turn on the dry block heater unit and set the temperature to allow the 3M Molecular Detection Heat Block Insert to reach and maintain a temperature of 100±1°C.
Depending on the heater unit, allow approximately 30 minutes for the 3M Molecular Detection Heat Block Insert to reach temperature. Using an appropriate, calibrated thermometer, (e.g., a partial immersion thermometer or digital thermocouple thermometer, not a total immersion thermometer) placed in the designated location, verify that the 3M Molecular Detection Heat Block Insert is at 100±1°C.</p>
<p>11.5.   Preparation of the 3M Molecular Detection Instrument
11.5.1. Launch the 3M Molecular Detection Software and log in.
11.5.2. Turn on the 3M Molecular Detection Instrument.
11.5.3. Create or edit a run with data for each sample. Refer to the 3M Molecular Detection System User Manual for details.
NOTE: The 3M Molecular Detection Instrument must reach and maintain temperature of 60°C before inserting the 3M Molecular Detection Speed Loader Tray with reaction tubes. The heating step takes approximately 20 minutes and is indicated by an ORANGE light on the instrument’s status bar. When the instrument is ready to start a run, the status bar will turn GREEN.</p>
<p>11.6.   Lysis
11.6.1. Allow the lysis solution (LS) tubes to warm up by setting the rack at room temperature (20-25°C) overnight (16-18 hours). Alternatives to equilibrate the LS tubes to room temperature are to set the LS tubes on the laboratory bench for at least 2 hours, incubate the LS tubes in a 37±1°C incubator for 1 hour or place them in a dry double heater for 30 seconds at 100°C.
11.6.2. Invert the capped tubes to mix. Proceed to next step within 4 hours.
11.6.3. Remove the enrichment broth from the incubator.
11.6.4. One LS tube is required for each sample and the Negative Control (NC) (sterile enrichment medium) sample.
11.6.4.1.   LS tube strips can be cut to desired LS tube number. Select the number of individual LS tubes or 8-tube strips needed. Place the LS tubes in an empty rack.
11.6.4.2.   To avoid cross-contamination, decap one LS tubes strip at a time and use a new pipette tip for each transfer step.
11.6.4.3.   Transfer enriched sample to LS tubes as described below:
Transfer each enriched sample into an individual LS tube first. Transfer the NC last.
11.6.4.4.   Use the 3M Molecular Detection Cap/Decap Tool-Lysis to decap one LS tube strip-one strip at a time.
11.6.4.5.   Discard the LS tube cap-if lysate will be retained for retest, place the caps in a clean container for re-application after lysis. For processing of retained lysate, see Appendix A.
11.6.4.6.   Transfer 20 µL of sample into a LS tube unless otherwise indicated in Protocol Table 2. e.g. Raw dairy products use 10 µL.
11.6.5. Repeat step 11.6.4.2 until each individual sample has been added to a corresponding LS tube in the strip.</p>
<p>11.6.6. Repeat step 11.6.4.1 to 11.6.4.6 as needed, for the number of samples to be tested.
11.6.7. When all samples have been transferred, transfer 20µL of NC (sterile enrichment medium, e.g., BPW) into a LS tube. Do not use water as a NC.
11.6.8. Verify that the temperature of the 3M Molecular Detection Heat Block Insert is at 100±1°C.
11.6.9. Place the uncovered rack of LS tubes in the 3M Molecular Detection Heat Block Insert and heat for 15±1 minutes. During heating, the LS solution will change from pink (cool) to yellow (hot).
Samples that have not been properly heat treated during the assay lysis step may be considered a potential biohazard and should NOT be inserted into the 3M Molecular Detection Instrument.
11.6.10.    Remove the uncovered rack of LS tubes from the heating block and allow to cool in the 3M Molecular Detection Chill Block Insert at least 5 minutes and a maximum of 10 minutes. The 3M Detection Chill Block Insert, used at ambient temperature without the Molecular Detection Chill Block Tray should sit directly on the laboratory bench. When cool, the lysis solution will revert to a pink color.
11.6.11.    Remove the rack of LS tubes from the 3M Molecular Detection Chill Block Insert</p>
<p>11.7.   Amplification
11.7.1. One Reagent tube is required for each sample and the NC.
11.7.1.1.   Reagent tube strips can be cut to desired tube number. Select the number of individual Reagent tubes or 8-tube strips needed.
11.7.1.2.   Place Reagent tubes in an empty rack.
11.7.1.3.   Avoid disturbing the reagent pellets from the bottom of the tubes.
11.7.2. Select 1 Reagent Control (RC) tube and place in rack.
11.7.3. To avoid cross-contamination, decap one Reagent tube strip at a time and use a new pipette tip for each transfer step.
11.7.4. Transfer lysate to Reagent tubes and RC tube as described below:
Transfer each sample lysate into individual Reagent tubes first followed by the NC. Hydrate the RC tube last.
11.7.5. Use the 3M Molecular Detection Cap/Decap Tool-Reagent to decap the Reagent tubes-one Reagent tube strip at a time. Discard cap.
11.7.5.1.   Transfer 20 µL of Sample lysate from the upper ½ of the liquid (avoid precipitate) in the LS tube into corresponding Reagent tube. Dispense at an angle to avoid disturbing the pellets. Mix by gently pipetting up and down 5 times.
11.7.5.2.   Repeat step 11.7.5.1 until individual sample lysate has been added to a corresponding Reagent tube in the strip.
11.7.5.3.   Cover the Reagent tubes with the provided extra caps and use the rounded side of the 3M Molecular Detection Cap/Decap Tool-Reagent to apply pressure in a back and forth motion ensuring that the cap is tightly applied.
11.7.5.4.   Repeat step 11.7.5.1 as needed, for the number of samples to be tested.
11.7.5.5.   When all sample lysates have been transferred, repeat 11.7.4 to transfer 20 µL of NC lysate into a Reagent tube.
11.7.5.6.   Transfer 20 µL of NC lysate into a RC tube. Dispense at an angle to avoid disturbing the pellets. Mix by gently pipetting up and down 5 times.
11.7.6. Load capped tubes into a clean and decontaminated 3M Molecular Detection Speed Loader Tray. Close and latch the 3M Molecular Detection Speed Loader Tray lid.
11.7.7. Review and confirm the configured run in the 3M Molecular Detection Software.
11.7.8. Click the Start button in the software and select instrument for use. The selected instrument’s lid automatically opens.
11.7.9. Place the 3M Molecular Detection Speed Loader Tray into the 3M Molecular Detection Instrument and close the lid to start the assay. Results are provided within 75 minutes, although positives may be detected sooner.
11.7.10.    After the assay is complete, remove the 3M Detection Speed Loader Tray from the 3M Molecular Detection Instrument and dispose of the tubes by soaking in a 1-5% (v:v in water) household bleach solution for 1 hour and away from the assay preparation area.</p>
<p>Notice: To minimize the risk of false positives due to cross-contamination, never open reagent tubes containing amplified DNA. This includes Reagent Control, Reagent, and Matrix Control tubes. Always dispose of sealed reagent tubes by soaking in a 1-5% (v:v in water) household bleach solution for 1 hour and away from the assay preparation area.</p>
<p>11.8.   Results and Interpretation
An algorithm interprets the light output curve resulting from the detection of the nucleic acid amplification. Results are analyzed automatically by the software and are color-coded based on the result. A Positive or Negative result is determined by analysis of a number of unique curve parameters. Presumptive positive results are reported in real-time while Negative and Inspect results will be displayed after the run is completed.</p>
<p>Presumptive positive samples should be confirmed as per the laboratory standard operating procedures or by following the appropriate reference method confirmation, beginning with transfer from the primary enrichment to secondary enrichment broth (if applicable), followed by subsequent plating and confirmation of isolated using appropriate biochemical and serological methods.</p>
<p>NOTE: Even a negative sample will not give a zero reading as the system and 3M Molecular Detection Assay 2- E. coli O157:H7 amplification reagents have a “background” relative light unit (RLU).</p>
<p>In the rare event of any unusual light output, the algorithm labels this as “Inspect.” 3M recommends the user to repeat the assay for any Inspect samples. In the result continues to be Inspect, proceed to confirmation testing using FDA BAM.</p>
