<h2 id="welcome">WELCOME!</h2>
<p>We would like to take this opportunity to welcome you to New Age/Landmark, Inc.</p>
<p>We are pleased to provide you with NAL’s Employee Handbook, which outlines the personnel policies and practices in effect at NAL. We are sure this employee handbook will be a helpful reference during your association with our company. We also encourage you to freely ask questions of management and co-workers whenever you might need clarification of the policies or procedures contained within this document. Please note that the Employee Handbook is not a contractual document.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Scott D. Wall
President
 </p>
<h2 id="10-introduction">1.0 INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The Employee Handbook has been prepared to introduce you to NAL. It will acquaint you with the policies, rules, pay, and benefits which apply to all employees at NAL
The information contained in this Employee Handbook is presented as a matter of information only and its contents are not, and should not be interpreted as, a contract for employment between NAL, and any of its employees.</p>
<p>Please read this Employee Handbook carefully and keep it handy for future reference. One of your first responsibilities as an employee of NAL is to be familiar with the contents of this handbook.</p>
<h3 id="11-policy-changes">1.1 Policy Changes</h3>
<p>NAL expressly reserves the right to adopt new and/or amend, at any time, any of the policies referenced herein. Employees will be notified of these changes by a memorandum which will supersede conflicting provisions of this handbook. Changes will be effective on dates determined by NAL, and employees may not rely on policies that have been superseded. In addition, only the President of NAL has any authority to alter the foregoing.</p>
<p>If an employee is uncertain about any policy or procedure, he/she should check with a corporate officer for clarification.</p>
<h3 id="12-employment-relationship">1.2 Employment Relationship</h3>
<p>Employment with NAL is “at-will” as defined by Michigan law. An employee is free to resign at any time, for any reason, with or without notice. Similarly, NAL is free to conclude the employment relationship at any time. (See Section 2.0 EMPLOYMENT POLICIES - 2.13 Resignation, page 7).</p>
<p>This Page is intentionally left blank.
 </p>
<h2 id="20-employment-policies">2.0 EMPLOYMENT POLICIES</h2>
<h3 id="21-definitions-of-employment-status">2.1 Definitions of Employment Status</h3>
<p>The following terms will be used to describe the classification of employees and their employment status:</p>
<p>Exempt - Employees whose positions meet specific tests established by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state laws, and who are exempt from overtime pay requirements.</p>
<p>Non-exempt - Employees whose positions do not meet FLSA and state exemption tests, and who are paid a multiple of their regular rate of pay for time worked in excess of forty (40) hours per week, in accordance with federal and state law.</p>
<p>Full-time - Employees regularly scheduled to work forty (40) hours or more per week.</p>
<p>Part-time - Employees regularly scheduled to work less than forty (40) hours per week.</p>
<p>Probationary - The first ninety (90) calendar days of a full-time or part-time employee’s employment with NAL</p>
<p>Regular - Employees who have completed the ninety (90) day orientation period.</p>
<p>Temporary - Employees who are hired for a pre-established period, usually during peak workloads or for personal leave relief. Temporary employees may work a full-time or part-time schedule; however, they are ineligible for NAL benefits.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, a “year” means a calendar year.</p>
<h3 id="22-equal-opportunityaffirmative-action">2.2 Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action</h3>
<p>NAL maintains a policy of non-discrimination with employees and applicants for employment. No aspect of employment with us will be influenced in any manner by race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, physical or mental disability, height, weight, marital or veteran status, or any other basis prohibited by statute. These policies are the result of a continued effort on the part of management to assure compliance with all applicable affirmative action legislation.</p>
<p>Further, the company reasonably accommodates persons with mental or physical disabilities in accordance with applicable state and federal laws.</p>
<p>NAL supports employment practices that are closely monitored to assure that we are reaching out and assisting minorities and women to provide meaningful employment and opportunities for advancement. All personnel actions such as compensation, benefits, transfer, layoffs, returns from layoff, and the NAL-sponsored training and education programs are to be free of unlawful discrimination.</p>
<p>While all employees are responsible for developing and implementing existing programs that will advance Equal Employment Opportunity at NAL, it shall be the primary responsibility of NAL corporate officers to monitor such programs.</p>
<p>NAL expects all of its employees to conduct themselves with dignity and with respect for fellow employees and others. Harassment of others based on any protected category such as gender, age, race, etc., will not be tolerated. NAL does not condone or allow harassment of others, whether engaged in by managers, fellow employees, or by vendors (other non-employees who conduct business with NAL).</p>
<p>Any person who believes he or she has been subjected to harassment should report it immediately to a corporate officer of NAL. Each report will be given serious consideration and investigated thoroughly. Appropriate action, such as discipline up to and including termination, will be taken to eliminate such harassment from the work place. All reports of harassment and subsequent investigations will be handled discretely.</p>
<h3 id="23-probationary-period-for-new-employees">2.3 Probationary Period for New Employees</h3>
<p>The probationary period for new employees is ninety (90) calendar days from date of hire. During this time, the employee has the opportunity to evaluate NAL, as a place of employment, and NAL, has the opportunity to evaluate the employee. During the probationary period, both the employee and the company have the right to terminate employment without advance notice and without cause.</p>
<p>The probationary period involves the evaluation of performance. Upon satisfactory completion of the probationary period, the employee status will be changed to regular. All employees, regardless of classification, status, or length of service, are expected to meet and maintain NAL’s standards for job performance and behavior.</p>
<p>The benefits provided as described in this handbook are available to each full-time employee. Part-time or temporary employees are not eligible for these benefits. For each new full-time regular employee most benefits will begin on the ninety-first (91st) day following full-time status. For some benefits (i.e. simple IRA), there are other waiting periods for full-time, regular employees (refer to section 4.0). The accrual of personal leave hours begins on the first day of full-time employment.</p>
<h3 id="24-personnel-records">2.4 Personnel Records</h3>
<p>Important events in each employee’s history with NAL will be recorded and kept in the employee’s personnel file. Performance reviews, change of status records, commendations, corrective action warnings, and educational attainment records are examples of records maintained.</p>
<p>Personnel files will be kept confidential to the extent consistent with the law. If an employee should want to review his/her file, he/she must contact a corporate officer to schedule an appointment.</p>
<p>All employees are responsible for notifying the company of changes in address, telephone number, and/or family status (births, marriage, death, divorce, legal separation, etc.), as income tax status and group insurance may be affected by these changes. This responsibility includes employees on layoff status and leaves of absence. Employees should also advise the company of any degrees or registrations obtained and of membership in any professional or technical organizations.</p>
<h3 id="25-standard-work-hours-and-time-sheets">2.5 Standard Work Hours and Time Sheets</h3>
<p>The standard work week consists of forty (40) hours between 12:01AM Monday and 12:00AM midnight the following Sunday. The normal work day starts at 8:00 AM and typically ends at 5:00PM, with lunch from 12:00PM noon to 1:00PM. If for any reason a “no work” day is declared, all exempt, full-time employees may receive their normal compensation at management’s discretion.</p>
<p>From time to time, schedules may be changed to meet project scheduling or other needs. Under these circumstances, notice will be given as far in advance as possible.</p>
<p>An employee’s time sheet is a legal record of the hours he/she is at work. Compensation is based on the time recorded on the employee’s time sheet. Each employee is responsible for the accuracy of his/her time sheet.</p>
<h3 id="26-job-descriptions">2.6 Job Descriptions</h3>
<p>At NAL, job descriptions are used to aid in staffing, wage and salary administration, and training. However, job descriptions are not contracts and are not fixed company policy; they are only guidelines and can be expected to change from time to time at the company’s discretion.</p>
<h3 id="27-duties">2.7 Duties</h3>
<p>Each employee shall devote his/her entire working time, attention, and energies to the business of NAL, and shall assume such further responsibilities and perform such duties as may be assigned to him/her from time to time by the company. Employees shall not engage directly or indirectly in any conflicting business activity requiring personal service, or which otherwise interferes with performance of duties for NAL.</p>
<h3 id="28-duty-not-to-divulge-corporate-information">2.8 Duty Not to Divulge Corporate Information</h3>
<p>Employees owe NAL a duty of confidentiality and loyalty. The employee shall not, at any time during his/her employment, or for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, divulge to any individual or company any matters relating to NAL, or to its clients and customers.</p>
<h3 id="29-ideas-developments-patents-inventions-etc">2.9 Ideas, Developments, Patents, Inventions, Etc.</h3>
<p>NAL can acquire the ownership of the employee’s inventions and patents if:</p>
<p>1) the employee is hired to develop/create inventions and product improvements,
2) the invention is related to the performance of the employee’s job; and/or
3) the invention is made or developed during billable work hours (time recorded on a NAL time sheet); or while using NAL tools or facilities and/or any portion of NAL finances.
NOTE: Facilities refers to any property secured, obtained, owned and/or leased by NAL.</p>
<h3 id="210-performance-appraisals">2.10 Performance Appraisals</h3>
<p>Normally, each employee will receive a performance appraisal every twelve (12) months. The performance appraisal allows the company to discuss overall performance and summarize both formal and informal performance discussions held throughout the review period. It will review strengths and also point out ways to improve performance.</p>
<h3 id="211-promotions-job-posting">2.11 Promotions; Job Posting</h3>
<p>NAL has a policy of promoting from within, whenever practical, to meet the growth needs of the company. The company will strive to promote the most qualified and experienced individual, based on demonstrated ability, to assume greater responsibility. At the same time, it may be necessary to recruit and hire outside of NAL in order to attract the most qualified individual for a particular opening. Outside recruiting sources are periodically used to fill open positions.</p>
<h3 id="212-payment-of-placement-fee-andor-relocation-fees">2.12 Payment of Placement Fee and/or Relocation Fees</h3>
<p>If NAL pays any person, agency, or bureau, a fee for placing the employee with the company and said employment is terminated by the employee within twelve (12) months from his/her date of hire, the employee agrees to reimburse NAL for all charges and fees paid by the company to said person, agency, or bureau.
If NAL pays any relocation fees, such as moving costs, temporary lodging, meals, rental, etc. for the employee as a condition of initial employment, and the employment is terminated by the employee, or by NAL, for cause within twelve (12) months of the first day of full-time employment, then the employee agrees to reimburse NAL all said charges and fees paid by NAL.</p>
<h3 id="213-resignation">2.13 Resignation</h3>
<p>Before deciding to leave NAL, please discuss your concerns with a corporate officer first. It is an important decision, and there might be factors you may not have considered. Of course, if you have an opportunity that is just too good to pass up, we congratulate you and offer our best wishes for your success. When you resign, your continuous service with NAL is ended; if you should ever rejoin NAL, you will start as a new employee of the company.</p>
<p>Please advise a corporate officer (in writing) at least two (2) weeks prior to your date of departure (unless stated otherwise in your employee agreement) so that an orderly transition can be made. This process includes turning in NAL property, completing required forms, and obtaining appropriate clearances.</p>
<h3 id="214-exit-interviews">2.14 Exit Interviews</h3>
<p>In most cases, when an employee leaves NAL, an exit interview will be conducted with a corporate officer on or before the last day of employment. The exit interview documents the reason for separation and solicits constructive feedback to improve NAL.</p>
<h3 id="215-office-temperature">2.15 Office Temperature</h3>
<p>Finding an office temperature that all personnel agree is comfortable is difficult due to variances in ceiling height, proximity to a drafty door or window, and differences in office attire. It has been decided that an average temperature of seventy (70) degrees Fahrenheit should provide a comfortable working temperature for most personnel year-round. In an effort to decrease the heat-loss and drafts in the building, curtains and blinds should be closed each evening during the winter months.</p>
<h3 id="216-visitors">2.16 Visitors</h3>
<p>All non-employees must have a company escort while on the premises. If an employee is expecting a visitor, advance notice should be given to the office staff.</p>
<h3 id="217-issuance-of-keys">2.17 Issuance of Keys</h3>
<p>Keys to the NAL facilities shall only be issued to employees by a corporate officer. Each employee shall be responsible for the return of any key issued to them and shall report any key that becomes missing. No employee shall allow a duplicate to be made of any key issued to them or to allow their keys to be used by another person.</p>
<h3 id="218-company-equipment">2.18 Company Equipment</h3>
<p>Use of any NAL equipment and materials shall be limited to company purposes. The care and maintenance of company-owned equipment is the responsibility of all employees. Keep the equipment clean and report any damages to a corporate officer.</p>
<h3 id="219-telephonevoice-mail-use">2.19 Telephone/Voice Mail Use</h3>
<p>NAL telephones are to be used for business purposes in serving the interests of our clients and in the course of normal company operations. Answer all calls promptly and courteously. On occasion, personal calls may be necessary, but we ask for the cooperation of all employees to limit these calls to emergencies or essential personal business and in keeping them brief.</p>
<h3 id="220-computer-hardwaresoftware-security">2.20 Computer Hardware/Software Security</h3>
<p>NAL equipment, including computer hardware and software, are valuable assets. They must be used for company business only. An employee may not copy or use any software that has been purchased/leased by NAL contrary to the provisions of the contract or without prior approval from a corporate officer.</p>
<p>When an employee is on personal leave, business trips or otherwise absent, said employee’s immediate supervisor may access their computer or files to better serve customers and other business needs.

<p>At the discretion of the company President NAL, will provide bonus compensation to employees as a means of rewarding outstanding corporate performance.

<h3 id="36-paydays">3.6 Paydays</h3>

In order to allow sufficient time to process the time sheets and to prepare payroll, there is an approximate two (2) week delay in receiving a paycheck.

If a payday occurs on an observed holiday, payment will take place on the first workday preceding the holiday.
 </p>
<h2 id="40-employee-benefits-and-services">4.0 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND SERVICES</h2>
<p>NAL strives to provide a competitive package of employee benefit programs for its eligible employees.</p>
<p>Complete and official details of insurance and payroll plans are contained in materials which employees receive on their first day of employment. The descriptions in this Employee Handbook are only brief summaries for your general information. Employees should contact a corporate officer for more details.</p>
<p>The existence of these employee benefits and plans, in and of themselves, does not signify that an employee will be employed for the requisite time necessary to qualify for these benefits and plans.</p>
<h3 id="41-group-insurance">4.1 Group Insurance</h3>
<p>NAL makes available and will pay up to $300.00 per month for the cost of health insurance premiums for full-time employees and their dependent family members. These insurance benefits become effective on the ninety-first (91st) day of full-time employment. For more details and official terms of these plans, refer to the group insurance Schedule of Benefits summary, which each employee will receive approximately thirty (30) days subsequent to employment.</p>
<h3 id="42-social-security">4.2 Social Security</h3>
<p>All employees are covered by the Federal Social Security Act. A required percentage of the employee’s salary is deducted from each paycheck to pay the employee’s portion of this protection, and NAL matches each deduction dollar for dollar. This federal plan is designed for the individuals’ future security and that of his/her dependents and provides for retirement, disability, death, and survivor/Medicare benefits.</p>
<h3 id="43-state-unemployment-insurance">4.3 State Unemployment Insurance</h3>
<p>This program is funded entirely by employers in this state. The program provides weekly benefits if the employee becomes unemployed through no fault of his/her own or due to circumstances described by law.</p>
<h3 id="44-workers-compensation">4.4 Workers’ Compensation</h3>
<p>NAL carries insurance to cover the cost of work-incurred injury or illness. Benefits help pay for medical treatment and part of any income lost while recovering. Specific benefits are prescribed by law depending on the circumstances of each case. To be assured of maximum coverage, work-related accidents must be reported immediately to management and a corporate officer. If necessary, NAL will file a timely claim on the employee’s behalf.</p>
<h3 id="45-simple-retirement-plan-ira">4.5 Simple Retirement Plan (IRA)</h3>
<p>This voluntary plan permits eligible employees to defer a portion of their earnings on a pre-tax basis to a savings plan allowed by Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). In order to become a participant, employees must complete six (6) months of full-time employment with NAL, and must be a minimum age of twenty-one (21).</p>
<p>While this plan has important savings and tax advantages, other aspects require careful consideration. Read the special booklet available describing the plan in detail and consult a corporate officer if there are any questions regarding eligibility.</p>
<h3 id="46-personal-leave-time">4.6 Personal Leave Time</h3>
<p>Regular, exempt, full-time employees accrue time toward their individual personal leave allowance (refer to Section 3.5). Personal leave time can be accrued up to a maximum of one hundred sixty (160) hours. Once your personal leave time reaches one hundred sixty (160) hours, all additionally accrued time is void until the banked hours fall below one hundred sixty (160). Personal leave time does roll over to the next calendar year, and therefore unused personal leave time is not paid out to employees at the end of a year.</p>
<p>Personal leave time for employees with hire dates prior to January 1st, 2008 is paid upon termination for regular, exempt, full-time employees. At termination a corporate officer will issue appropriate funds. There is no payment of personal leave time at termination/resignation for employees with hire dates after January 1st, 2008.</p>
<p>Personal leave must be scheduled and approved by the employee’s immediate supervisor and countersigned by a corporate officer. To ensure that each request is approved and to assure that appropriate staffing can be maintained, the employee must discuss all leave plans in advance with his/her immediate supervisor. Extended leave (multiple day requests) must be scheduled at least one month prior to the requested time. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, employees are discouraged from taking extended leave between April 15th and October 31st.</p>
<h3 id="47-holidays">4.7 Holidays</h3>
<p>Exempt and non-exempt, full-time employees are eligible for eight (8) paid holidays in each calendar year. For non-exempt employees, a paid holiday does not count as a day worked in calculating overtime for the week. Holidays that are observed by NAL are as follows:</p>

<p>Leaves of absence without pay may be granted by law and/or at NAL’s discretion to eligible employees to maintain continuity of service in instances where unusual or unavoidable circumstances require prolonged absence. The determination for granting such a leave of absence shall be based upon the nature of the request. The employee may be required to use accrued unused personal leave time before being granted a leave of absence. Leaves of absence without pay are of the following types:</p>

For that period of time when an employee is on a leave of absence, fringe benefits paid by NAL, shall be suspended after thirty (30) days. The employee may make arrangements with NAL, to make premium payments on health insurance beyond this 30-day period at the employee’s cost. See a corporate officer for these details.</p>
<p>It is NAL’s policy to reinstate a person after a leave of absence to the same position held at the time the leave of absence began, when possible. If the position is not available at the end of such leave of absence, the person will have the opportunity to be evaluated by NAL, and to be recommended to fill another position, if one exists, or an opening for which they are qualified. If no position is available, or the person does not qualify for an existing position, the person may be placed on layoff status.</p>
<p>If it is determined that an employee has accepted employment elsewhere or the employee fails to return to work after the authorized leave, their employment will be automatically terminated.</p>
<h3 id="410-return-to-work">4.10 Return to Work</h3>
<p>If an employee is on a disability or medical disability leave of absence, said employee must return to work when his/her physician or when a NAL-appointed physician determines ability to resume normal duties. NAL requires a physician’s release before reinstatement to the active payroll. If an employee wishes to extend their leave beyond this point, he/she must apply for a personal leave of absence.</p>
<p>A physician’s release may also be required when returning to work from other short-term, medically-related absences. The employee’s immediate supervisor will advise him/her of this requirement, which depends on case-by-case circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="411-education-assistance">4.11 Education Assistance</h3>

<p>If the discussion with the employee’s immediate supervisor does not answer the question or resolve the matter, the employee may then present the complaint, in writing, to a corporate officer. When the issue personally involves the immediate supervisor, the employee may choose to bypass that individual and proceed to the next person in authority without fear of reprisal. However, whenever possible, the employee is encouraged to first discuss the issue with his/her supervisor. An employee may seek the advice and guidance of the company’s corporate officer(s) at any time as NAL practices an open-door policy with employees at all levels.</p>
<h3 id="54-dispute-resolution-and-review">5.4 Dispute, Resolution, and Review</h3>
<p>NAL believes that in any organization differences in which a company interprets and applies policies are bound to occur. Discussing and settling differences promptly and fairly will make the company more productive and a better place to work for all employees. If an employee does not agree with the manner in which a policy is interpreted or applied, the employee may (in writing) submit the basis for disagreement to his/her immediate supervisor who will acknowledge its receipt and forward it to the president for review and consideration.

<h3 id="56-media-relations">5.6 Media Relations</h3>

<h2 id="70-standards-of-conduct-and-corrective-action">7.0 STANDARDS OF CONDUCT AND CORRECTIVE ACTION</h2>
<p>Groups of people working together, for any purpose, require certain guidelines pertaining to conduct and relationships. Accordingly, all employees must be aware of their responsibilities to NAL and to their co-workers.</p>
<p>NAL strives to take a constructive approach to disciplinary matters ensuring that actions which interfere with company operations or an employee’s job are not continued.</p>
<p>NAL reserves the right to search an employee’s personal effects such as tool boxes, desks, lockers, etc., on NAL premises. Any search of personal effects will be conducted by the employee’s supervisor or a corporate officer in addition to a witness. The witness may be another employee, supervisor or corporate officer. Return of company equipment or company distributed materials may be required. Employees are expected to comply with all requests. Non-compliance will result in corrective action up to or including termination.</p>
<p>Violations of standards will result in one of the following forms of corrective action: termination, suspension without pay, or written warning. In arriving at a decision for proper action, the following will be considered:</p>
<p>• The seriousness of the infraction<br />
• The past record of the employee<br />
• The circumstances surrounding the matter  </p>
<p>There is no way to identify every possible violation of standards of conduct. A partial list of infractions which will result in corrective action is as follows:</p>
<p>• Falsifying an employment application, time sheet, personnel file, or other NAL documents or records.<br />
• Using, possessing, distributing, purchasing, or selling a controlled substance(s) while on NAL premises or while engaged in professional services to a client.<br />
• Reporting to and/or performing work for NAL under the influence of a controlled substance(s) or alcohol.<br />
• Unauthorized possession of NAL or other employee property, gambling, weapons or explosives, or violating criminal laws on NAL or client-owned premises.<br />
• Fighting, throwing objects, horseplay, practical jokes, or other disorderly conduct which may endanger the well-being of any person on NAL premises.
• Engaging in acts of dishonesty, fraud, theft, or sabotage.<br />
• Threatening, intimidating, coercing, using abusive language, or interfering with the performance of other employees.<br />
• Insubordination or refusal to comply with instructions or failure to perform reasonable duties which are assigned.<br />
• Damaging or destroying NAL property due to careless acts.<br />
• Conduct which NAL feels reflects adversely on the employee or NAL.<br />
• Performance which, in NAL’s opinion, does not meet the requirements of the position.<br />
• Engaging in such other practices as NAL determines may be inconsistent with the ordinary and reasonable rules of conduct necessary to the welfare of NAL, its employees, or its clients.<br />
• Negligence in observing fire prevention and safety rules.<br />
• Other circumstances for which NAL feels that corrective action is warranted.  </p>
<p>This list is intended to only be a sampling of the types of activities which may result in disciplinary action. It is not intended to be comprehensive and does not alter the employment-at-will relationship between the employee and NAL.</p>
<h3 id="71-conflict-of-interest">7.1 Conflict of Interest</h3>
<p>We expect our employees to conduct business according to the highest ethical standards of conduct. Employees are expected to devote their best efforts to the interests of NAL and the conduct of its affairs. Business dealings that create, or appear to create, a conflict between the interests of NAL and an employee are unacceptable. NAL recognizes the right of employees to engage in activities outside of their employment which are of a private nature and unrelated to our business. However, a policy of full disclosure must be followed to assess and prevent potential conflicts of interest from arising. Contact a corporate officer if you have questions regarding possible conflicts.</p>
<h3 id="72-harassment">7.2 Harassment</h3>
<p>Every NAL employee has the right to a workplace free from harassment. Harassment of anyone on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, age, sex, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, marital status or other protected categories is prohibited by law and by the policies of this company.</p>
<p>Harassment can include such behavior as slurs, demeaning jokes or comments, innuendoes, unwelcome compliments, cartoons, pictures, pranks, gestures, stereotypical comments, derogatory descriptions or other verbal or physical conduct. Behavior is considered harassment when it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment; unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance; and/or affects an individual’s workplace opportunities.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment occurs when the verbal or physical conduct described above is sexual in nature or gender-based. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other conduct of a sexual nature; making submission to or rejection of such conduct the basis for employment decisions; and/or creating an intimidating, offensive or hostile working environment by such conduct.</p>
<p>Any employee who believes that he or she has been the subject of unwelcome harassment from another employee, a supervisor or manager, or from an outside party in the workplace, or who has observed harassment in the workplace, is encouraged to identify the offensive behavior and request that it stop. If you are unable to address the matter directly with the harasser, or if you do and the behavior continues, report the matter directly to your immediate supervisor or another member of the management team.</p>
<p>All complaints will be investigated promptly, impartially, and discreetly. Upon completion of the investigation, the appropriate parties will be notified of the findings. If any employee is found by the company to have harassed another employee, appropriate corrective action will be taken. This could range from a disciplinary warning, training or reassignment to suspension or termination. Management will also take prompt remedial action to prevent or stop harassment of employees on the job by vendors, customers or other third parties.</p>
<p>No employee will suffer retaliation for reporting in good faith alleged instances of harassment. Employees and management must work together to prevent and stop harassing conduct in the workplace.</p>
<p>We trust all employees to act responsibly to maintain a safe workplace, to treat each other with dignity and respect, and to work to maintain a workplace free of discrimination and harassment.</p>
<h3 id="73-attendance-standards">7.3 Attendance Standards</h3>
<p>Punctuality and regular attendance are essential to the proper operation of any business. These also help the employee to establish a good working reputation and will be considered at his/her annual review.</p>
<p>If an employee is unable to report for work for any reason, will arrive late, or must leave early, notification must be made to his/her immediate supervisor before the workday (in the event of absence or tardiness), or as early as possible (to leave early).</p>
<h3 id="74-absence-without-notice">7.4 Absence Without Notice</h3>
<p>To operate our business effectively employees must keep the company informed of his/her status when off work because of illness or accident. Failure to notify the company of status after three (3) days of consecutive absence will be considered a resignation, and the employee will be removed from the payroll effective the last day of attendance. Likewise, employees must call his/her immediate supervisor daily while off work due to short-term illness or accident, or it will be presumed the employee has resigned. The employee will be removed from the payroll. If an employee must leave work for any reason before the end of the day, please inform your immediate supervisor.</p>
<h3 id="75-solicitation-and-distribution">7.5 Solicitation and Distribution</h3>
<p>Soliciting by one employee of another, or collecting from one employee by another, is prohibited while either employee is on work time. Distributing literature and circulating petitions during work time or in work areas at any time is also prohibited. Trespassing, soliciting, or distributing literature by anyone outside NAL is prohibited on NAL’s premises. Solicitation includes email, telephone calls, and handbills.</p>
<h3 id="76-alcohol-and-drugs">7.6 Alcohol and Drugs</h3>
<p>NAL is a drug-free environment and recognizes that alcohol and drug abuse in any work place is a major concern. We believe that by reducing drug and alcohol use the safety, health, and productivity of employees will be improved. The object of NAL’s alcohol and drug policy is to provide a safe and healthy work place for all employees, to comply with federal and state health and safety regulations, and to prevent accidents and/or injuries.</p>
<p>The policy prohibits NAL employees or NAL subcontractors from:</p>
<p>• Using, possessing, distributing, purchasing, or selling drugs or alcohol while on NAL premises or while engaged in NAL business.<br />
NOTE: An exception may be made regarding alcohol at company-authorized functions.<br />
• Reporting to and/or performing work for NAL under the influence of unauthorized drugs or alcohol.  </p>
<p>NAL may conduct drug and alcohol testing of an employee under the following circumstances:  </p>
<p>Pre-Employment Testing - All applicants for employment, at NAL’s discretion, are required to submit to laboratory testing following their acceptance of a contingent job offer and prior to beginning work (drug screen only).</p>
<p>Reasonable Suspicion Testing - When responsible officials have reasonable suspicion to believe an employee is in violation of NAL’s drug and alcohol policy.  </p>
<p>NAL defines a safety sensitive position as one in which the employee can directly influence operations to the extent that an improper action or failure to take appropriate action could result in injury or death of employees or others and/or property or environmental damage and where others may have no opportunity to recognize, intervene, or rectify a mistake before the harm occurs.</p>
<p>Violation of the NAL drug and alcohol policy constitutes just cause for termination of the employee.</p>
<h3 id="77-confidentiality">7.7 Confidentiality</h3>
<p>During the course of employment with NAL employees will be working with clients, client lists, business systems, future plans, research and development data, and other information that is considered confidential. Maintaining confidentiality is important to the company’s competitive position in the industry and ultimately, to the ability to achieve financial success and provide employment stability. Protect this information by safeguarding it when in use, filing it properly when not in use, and discussing it only with those who have a legitimate business need to know.</p>
<h3 id="78-dress-and-personal-appearance">7.8 Dress and Personal Appearance</h3>
<p>All NAL staff are expected to adhere to an internal dress code policy. This policy has been developed in an effort to maintain and project professionalism within the firm to co-workers, to members of our current and potential client base, and within the business community in general. Personal attire not only impacts others’ perceptions, but also affects the individuals’ professional performance.</p>
<p>New Age/Landmark dress code requires either corporate logoed shirts or jacket when working on-site, appropriate pants or skirts, appropriate footwear, as well as any required and/or assigned personal protective equipment when in the laboratory. All staff are expected to wear clothing appropriate for planned activities, job responsibilities (adherence to the Chemical Hygiene Plan is a must for employees working in a laboratory), and weather conditions.</p>
<p>Sandals, cut-off shorts, sweat pants, and torn or soiled clothing are not acceptable for any staff, whether in the office or in the laboratory. At no time should bandanas or dew rags be worn. Please note that if you choose not to adhere to this dress code policy, you will be asked to leave work and change into appropriate attire using personal time, not company time.</p>
<h3 id="79-smoking">7.9 Smoking</h3>
<p>For reasons of safety, public relations, and other concerns, smoking is prohibited in NAL laboratory facilities, at job sites, and in all company vehicles (the laboratories and vehicles contain expensive equipment that must be kept as clean and pollutant-free as possible).</p>
